Support files for an i-PI Tutorial
=================================

This repository contains support files as well as the LaTeX sources
for the exercise sheets for a series of three tutorials explaining 
how to compute static and dynamical quantum properties of matter
by performing path integral simulations using atomistic models. 

The examples are meant to be run with a development version of i-PI
and use some utilities that are available as part of the toolbox 
package. See http://cosmo.epfl.ch for more details of the softare
needed to perform these tutorials.
