abstract = {<p><br/>2-O-Sulfo-[alpha]-l-iduronic acid (IdoA2S) is one of the main components of heparin, an anticoagulant and antithrombotic polysaccharide able to potentiate the inhibitory effect of antithrombin over plasma serine proteases. This monosaccharide unit adopts an equilibrium between chair (1C4) and skew-boat (2SO) forms as a function of heparin sequence size and composition. Although the prevalence of the 1C4 chair conformation in monosaccharides is understood, the reasons for the increase in 2SO contribution in the whole polysaccharide chain are still uncertain. In this context, 0.2 [mu]s molecular dynamics simulations of IdoA2S-containing oligosaccharides indicated that stabilization due to intramolecular hydrogen bonds around IdoA2S is highly correlated (p [less-than-or-equals, slant] 0.001) with the expected conformational equilibrium for this residue in solution. This behavior explains the known effect of different heparin compositions, at the monosaccharide level, on IdoA2S conformation in biological solutions.</p>},

The pentasaccharide has a rather rigid (As---G---A*) and a more flexible (Is---AM) region. A simplified model of 1, comprising two conformations, corresponding to the 1C4 and the 2So forms of the iduronate residue, and modified at the G---A* glycosidic linkage with respect to the energy minimum, reproduces most of the observed 3J values and n.O.e. enhancements. The possible role in the binding to Antithrombin III of a low-energy conformer, not observed in solution, is discussed.</p>},

Even this, however, is hardly practicable$\backslash$nwhen one has to deal with very many electrons, so that one then requires$\backslash$na still simpler and rougher method. Such a method is provided by$\backslash$nThomas' atomic model, in which the electrons are regarded as forming$\backslash$na perfect gas satisfying the Fermi statistics and occupying the region$\backslash$nof phase space of lowest energy. This region of phase space is assumed$\backslash$nto be saturated, with two electrons with opposite spins in each volume$\backslash$n(2$\pi$h)3, and the remainder is assumed to be empty. Although this model$\backslash$nhitherto has not been justified theoretically, it seems to be a plausible$\backslash$napproximation for the interior of a heavy atom and one may expect$\backslash$nit to give with some accuracy the distribution of electric charge$\backslash$nthere.},

We show that sampling efficiency increases with increasing exchange-attempt frequency. This conclusion is contrary to a commonly expressed view in REMD. Five peptides (1-21 residues long) are studied with a spectrum of exchange-attempt rates. Convergence rates are gauged by comparing ensemble properties between fixed length test REMD simulations and longer reference simulations. To show the fundamental correlation between exchange frequency and convergence time, a simple model is designed and studied, displaying the same basic behavior of much more complex systems.},

abstract = {Standard density functional approximations cannot accurately describe interactions between nonoverlapping densities. A simple remedy consists in correcting for the missing interactions a posteriori, adding an attractive energy term summed over all atom pairs. The density-dependent energy correction, dDsC, presented herein, is constructed from dispersion coefficients computed on the basis of a generalized gradient approximation to Becke and Johnson's exchange-hole dipole moment formalism. dDsC also relies on an extended Tang and Toennies damping function accounting for charge-overlap effects. The comprehensive benchmarking on 341 diverse reaction energies divided into 18 illustrative test sets validates the robust performance and general accuracy of dDsC for describing various intra- and intermolecular interactions. With a total MAD of 1.3 kcal mol?1, B97-dDsC slightly improves the results of M06-2X and B2PLYP-D3 (MAD = 1.4 kcal mol?1 for both) at a lower computational cost. The density dependence of both the dispersion coefficients and the damping function makes the approach especially valuable for modeling redox reactions and charged species in general.},

abstract = {Metadynamics is a powerful technique for enhancing sampling inmolecular dy- namics simulations and reconstructing the free-energy surface as a function of few selected degrees of freedom, often referred to as collective variables (CVs). In metadynamics, sampling is accelerated by a history-dependent bias potential, which is adaptively constructed in the space of the CVs. Since its first appearance, significant improvements have beenmade to the original algorithm, leading to an efficient, flexible, and accurate method that has found many successful applica- tions in several domains of science. Here, we discuss first the theory underlying metadynamics and its recent developments. In particular, we focus on the crucial issue of choosing an appropriate set ofCVsand onthe possible strategies to allevi- ate this difficulty. Later in the second part,we present a few recent representative applications,which we have classified into three main classes: solid-state physics, chemical reactions, and biomolecules.},

abstract = {An empirical method has been designed to account for the van der Waals interactions in practical molecular calculations with density functional theory. For each atom pair separated at a distance R, the method adds to the density functionalelectronic structure calculations an additional attraction energy E vdW =−f d (R)C 6 R −6 , where f d (R) is the damping function which equals to one at large value of R and zero at small value of R. The coefficients C 6 for pair interactions between hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms have been developed in this work by a least-square fitting to the molecular C 6 coefficients obtained from the dipole oscillator strength distribution method by Meath and co-workers. Two forms of the damping functions have been studied, with one dropping to zero at short distances much faster than the other. Four density functionals have been examined: Becke’s three parameter hybrid functional with the Lee-Yang-Parr correlation functional, Becke’s 1988 exchange functional with the LYP correlation functional, Becke’s 1988 exchange functional with Perdew and Wang’s 1991 (PW91) correlation functional, and PW91 exchange and correlation functional. The method has been applied to three systems where the van der Waals attractions are known to be important: rare-gas diatomic molecules, stacking of base pairs and polyalanines’ conformation stabilities. The results show that this empirical method, with the damping function dropping to zero smoothly, provides a significant correction to both of the Becke’s hybrid functional and the PW91 exchange and correlation functional. Results are comparable to the corresponding second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset calculations in many cases.},

abstract = {The catalytic activity of a series of ruthenium(II) complexes in azide-alkyne cycloadditions has been evaluated. The [Cp*RuCl] complexes, such as Cp*RuCl(PPh 3) 2, Cp*RuCl(COD), and Cp*RuCl(NBD), were among the most effective catalysts. In the presence of catalytic Cp*RuCl(PPh 3) 2 or Cp*RuCl(COD), primary and secondary azides react with a broad range of terminal alkynes containing a range of functionalities selectively producing 1,5-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazoles; tertiary azides were significantly less reactive. Both complexes also promote the cycloaddition reactions of organic azides with internal alkynes, providing access to fully-substituted 1,2,3-triazoles. The ruthenium-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (RuAAC) appears to proceed via oxidative coupling of the azide and alkyne reactants to give a six-membered ruthenacycle intermediate, in which the first new carbon-nitrogen bond is formed between the more electronegative carbon of the alkyne and the terminal, electrophilic nitrogen of the azide. This step is followed by reductive elimination, which forms the triazole product. DFT calculations support this mechanistic proposal and indicate that the reductive elimination step is rate-determining.},

abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms of chemical reactions, especially catalysis, has been an important and active area of computational organic chemistry, and close collaborations between experimentalists and theorists represent a growing trend. This Perspective provides examples of such productive collaborations. The understanding of various reaction mechanisms and the insight gained from these studies are emphasized. The applications of various experimental techniques in elucidation of reaction details as well as the development of various computational techniques to meet the demand of emerging synthetic methods, e.g., C-H activation, organocatalysis, and single electron transfer, are presented along with some conventional developments of mechanistic aspects. Examples of applications are selected to demonstrate the advantages and limitations of these techniques. Some challenges in the mechanistic studies and predictions of reactions are also analyzed.},

@article{Marinari1992,
abstract = {PACS. 05.20 -Statistical mechanics. PACS. 75.50 -Dielectric breakdown and space-charge effects. Abstract. -We propose a new global optimization method (Simulated Tempering) for simulating effectively a system with a rough free-energy landscape (i.e., many coexisting states) at finite nonzero temperature. This method is related to simulated annealing, but here the temperature becomes a dynamic variable, and the system is always kept at equilibrium. We analyse the method on the Random Field Ising Model, and we find a dramatic improvement over conventional Metropolis and cluster methods. We analyse and discuss the conditions under which the method has optimal performances. Simulated annealing is an efficient heuristic method which is used to find the absolute minimum of functions with many local minima: it has been introduced independently in the framework of the Monte Carlo approach for discrete variables in ref.[l], and in the framework of stochastic differential equations (of Langevin type) for continuous variables in ref. [2]. The essence of the method consists of the following. Let us suppose that we are interested in finding the minimum of a function H(X), where X denotes an element of the configuration space (which has dimension N , where N is often a very high number). In most cases we do not know any method which can guarantee to find the minimum of H(x> with a computational effort that does not increase more than polynomially in N. In these cases one can try as a first guess a random search starting from a random configuration and minimizing H (X) with a steepest-descent algorithm. If the number of local minima increases as exp [ yN], with y different from zero, it often happens that this method also takes an exponentially large number of trials (ie., exp [NI, with in general 6 c 7).},

However, there is a lack of basic understanding of the mechanisms of cinchona-based primary aminocatalysis. Herein, we describe how a combination of experimental and theoretical mechanistic studies has revealed the origin of the stereoselectivity of the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of indoles with $\alpha$,$\beta$-unsaturated ketones catalyzed by 9-amino(9-deoxy)epi quinine. An essential role for the achiral acid cocatalyst is uncovered: upon condensation of the cinchona catalyst with the enone, the resulting covalent imine intermediate and the acid interact to build-up a well-structured ion-pair supramolecular catalytic assembly, which is stabilized by multiple attractive noncovalent interactions. All the components of the assembly cooperatively participate in the stereocontrolling event, with the anion of the achiral acid being the structural element responsible for the $\pi$-facial discrimination of the iminium ion intermediate.},

abstract = {The treatment of dispersion interactions is ubiquitous but computationally demanding for seamless ab initio approaches. A highly popular and simple remedy consists in correcting for the missing interactions a posteriori by adding an attractive energy term summed over all atom pairs to standard density functional approximations. These corrections were originally based on atom pairwise parameters and, hence, had a strong touch of empiricism. To overcome such limitations, we recently proposed a robust system-dependent dispersion correction, dDsC, that is computed from the electron density and that provides a balanced description of both weak inter- and intramolecular interactions. From the theoretical point of view and for the sake of increasing reliability, we here verify if the self-consistent implementation of dDsC impacts ground-state properties such as interaction energies, electron density, dipole moments, geometries, and harmonic frequencies. In addition, we investigate the suitability of the a posteriori scheme for molecular dynamics simulations, for which the analysis of the energy conservation constitutes a challenging tests. Our study demonstrates that the post-SCF approach in an excellent approximation.},

abstract = {We have uncovered new evidence for a significant interaction between divalent sulfur atoms and aromatic rings. Our study involves a statistical analysis of interatomic distances and other geometric descriptors derived from entries in the Cambridge Crystallographic Database (F. H. Allen and O. Kennard, Chem. Design Auto. News, 1993, Vol. 8, pp. 1 and 31-37). A set of descriptors was defined sufficient in number and type so as to elucidate completely the preferred geometry of interaction between six-membered aromatic carbon rings and divalent sulfurs for all crystal structures of nonmetal-bearing organic compounds present in the database. In order to test statistical significance, analogous probability distributions for the interaction of the moiety X-CH(2)-X with aromatic rings were computed, and taken a priori to correspond to the null hypothesis of no significant interaction. Tests of significance were carried our pairwise between probability distributions of sulfur-aromatic interaction descriptors and their CH(2)-aromatic analogues using the Smirnov-Kolmogorov nonparametric test (W. W. Daniel, Applied Nonparametric Statistics, Houghton-Mifflin: Boston, New York, 1978, pp. 276-286), and in all cases significance at the 99{\%} confidence level or better was observed. Local maxima of the probability distributions were used to define a preferred geometry of interaction between the divalent sulfur moiety and the aromatic ring. Molecular mechanics studies were performed in an effort to better understand the physical basis of the interaction. This study confirms observations based on statistics of interaction of amino acids in protein crystal structures (R. S. Morgan, C. E. Tatsch, R. H. Gushard, J. M. McAdon, and P. K. Warme, International Journal of Peptide Protein Research, 1978, Vol. 11, pp. 209-217; R. S. Morgan and J. M. McAdon, International Journal of Peptide Protein Research, 1980, Vol. 15, pp. 177-180; K. S. C. Reid, P. F. Lindley, and J. M. Thornton, FEBS Letters, 1985, Vol. 190, pp. 209-213), as well as studies involving molecular mechanics (G. Nemethy and H. A. Scheraga, Biochemistry and Biophysics Research Communications, 1981, Vol. 98, pp. 482-487) and quantum chemical calculations (B. V. Cheney, M. W. Schulz, and J.

Pranata, Bioorganic Chemistry, 1997, Vol. 25, pp. 213-219)-all of which point to the possible importance of the sulfur-aromatic interaction. However, the preferred geometry of the interaction, as determined from our analysis of the small-molecule crystal data, differs significantly from that found by other approaches.},

abstract = {A small change in the Hamiltonian scaling in Replica Exchange with Solute Tempering (REST) is found to improve its sampling efficiency greatly, especially for the sampling of aqueous protein solutions in which there are large-scale solute conformation changes. Like the original REST (REST1), the new version (which we call REST2) also bypasses the poor scaling with system size of the standard Temperature Replica Exchange Method (TREM), reducing the number of replicas (parallel processes) from what must be used in TREM. This reduction is accomplished by deforming the Hamiltonian function for each replica in such a way that the acceptance probability for the exchange of replica configurations does not depend on the number of explicit water molecules in the system. For proof of concept, REST2 is compared with TREM and with REST1 for the folding of the trpcage and $\beta$-hairpin in water. The comparisons confirm that REST2 greatly reduces the number of CPUs required by regular replica exchange and greatly increases the sampling efficiency over REST1. This method reduces the CPU time required for calculating thermodynamic averages and for the ab initio folding of proteins in explicit water.},

Letters 36 (1975) 451] is assessed in the light of recently published dispersion forces coefficients and high precision SCF HF calculations of the repulsive interaction, performed by us, on closed shell spherical systems. The method is found to give very accurate predictions for systems with a small number of electrons and leads to the conclusion that those systems behave as the internal atomic correlation energy was almost independent from the interatomic distance. The extension of the method to heavier systems is discussed. Its application to the prediction of the potential in a mixture when the pure gas interactions are known is presented and the results shown to be satisfactory. The isotropic part of the interaction between two hydrogen molecules can also be described quite well using the same procedure.},

abstract = {We present a theoretical study of the formation of the first intermediate, dimethyl ether, in the methanol to gasoline conversion within the framework of an ab initio molecular dynamics approach. The study is performed under conditions that closely resemble the reaction conditions in the zeolite catalyst including the full topology of the framework. The use of the method of thermodynamic integration allows us to extract the free-energy profile along the reaction coordinate. We find that the entropic contribution qualitatively alters the free-energy profile relative to the total energy profile. Different transition states are found from the internal and free energy profiles. The entropy contribution varies significantly along the reaction coordinate and is responsible for stabilizing the products and for lowering the energy barrier. The hugely inhomogeneous variation of the entropy can be understood in terms of elementary processes that take place during the chemical reaction. Our simulations provide new insights into the complex nature of this chemical reaction.},

abstract = {The cycloadditions of tetrazines with cyclopropenes and other strained alkenes have become among the most valuable bioorthogonal reactions. These reactions lead to bicyclic Diels-Alder adducts that spontaneously lose N2. We report quantum mechanical (QM) and quasiclassical trajectory simulations on a number of these reactions, with special attention to stereoelectronic and dynamic effects on spontaneous N2 loss from these adducts. QM calculations show that the barrier to N2 loss is low, and molecular dynamics calculations show that the intermediate is frequently bypassed dynamically. There is a large preference for N2 loss anti to the cyclopropane moiety rather than syn from adducts formed from reactions with cyclopropenes. This is explained by the interactions of the Walsh orbitals of the cyclopropane group with the breaking C-N bonds in N2 loss. Dynamical effects opposing the QM preferences have also been discovered involving the coupling of vibrations associated with the formation of the new C-C bonds in the cycloaddition step, and those of the breaking C-N bonds during subsequent N2 loss. This dynamic matching leads to pronounced nonstatistical effects on the lifetimes of Diels-Alder intermediates. An unusual oscillatory behavior of the intermediate decay rate has been identified and attributed to specific vibrational coupling.},

In this set, described as 4–31 G, each inner shell is represented by a single basis function taken as a sum of four Gaussians and each valence orbital is split into inner and outer parts described by three and one Gaussian function, respectively. The expansion coefficients and Gaussian exponents are determined by minimizing the total calculated energy of the atomic ground state. This basis set is then used in single‐determinant molecular‐orbital studies of a group of small polyatomic molecules. Optimization of valence‐shell scaling factors shows that considerable rescaling of atomic functions occurs in molecules, the largest effects being observed for hydrogen and carbon. However, the range of optimum scale factors for each atom is small enough to allow the selection of a standard molecular set. The use of this standard basis gives theoretical equilibrium geometries in reasonable agreement with experiment.},

The validity of the method is established using general results for systems with multiple time-scales, and its numerical efficiency is also discussed via error analysis. We also show how the method can be modified in order to sample the reactive pathways in free energy space, and thereby analyze the mechanism of a reaction.

Although many variations of the reaction conditions giving adenine have been reported since then, the mechanistic details remain unexplored. Our predictions are based on extensive computations of sequences of reaction steps along several possible mechanistic routes. H(2)O- or NH(3)-catalyzed pathways are more favorable than uncatalyzed neutral or anionic alternatives, and they may well have been the major source of adenine on primitive earth. Our report provides a more detailed understanding of some of the chemical processes involved in chemical evolution, and a partial answer to the fundamental question of molecular biogenesis.

abstract = {The approach of a multiscale simulation that combines quantum chemical calculations, classical molecular dynamics simulations, and statistical physics to integrate the information of the electronic states of a conformationally complex molecule into its structural distribution over an ensemble was performed to understand the influence of a polar organic solvent on the structural stability of carotene-porphyrin-fullerene molecular triad in both the ground and the photoinduced charge-separated excited states. The excited states of the triad were computed with the ab initio quantum chemical calculations using the algebraic diagrammatic construction through the second order correction (ADC(2)) method and the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). The replica exchange molecular dynamics was used for the enhanced sampling of the ensemble in order to explore the phase space of the ground state and the photoinduced charge-separated excited state of triad in explicit tetrahydrofuran (THF) solvent. An importance sampling was strategically employed to bridge the gap between the two computational methods that aim to explore distinct realms of dynamics. We analyzed the free energy landscape, the structural fluctuations, the solvent arrangements, the static dielectric constant, and the interactions between the triad and the solvent molecules. The analysis of the free energy landscape of the triad indicates that the charge-separated excited state of the triad is thermodynamically stable in a linearly extended geometry, while the ground-state triad explores several extended and bent conformations that are populated in the local free energy minima separated by low free energy barriers at an order of thermal fluctuation (k(B)T). The stabilization of a linearly extended structure of the charge-separated excited state triad is predominantly due to the solvation interactions (van der Waals and electrostatic interactions) between the triad and the THF molecules as well as the interactions within the THF molecules. Differences in the charge distribution on a molecular triad induce slight changes in the dielectric property of THF near the triad. Our study suggests that by measuring the differences in a dielectric response of solvent near the triad, it is possible to provide insight into the population of the charge-separated electronic state of the triad relative to that of the ground state.},

In particular, Hartree–Fock and standard density-functional approximations do not include the physics necessary to properly describe dispersion. These methods are sometimes corrected to account for dispersion by adding a pairwise C6/R6 term, with C6 dispersion coefficients dependent on the atoms involved. We present a post-Hartree–Fock model in which C6 coefficients are generated by the instantaneous dipole moment of the exchange hole. This model relies on occupied orbitals only, and involves only one, universal, empirical parameter to limit the dispersion energy at small interatomic separations. The model is extensively tested on isotropic C6 coefficients of 178 intermolecular pairs. It is also applied to the calculation of the geometries and binding energies of 20 intermolecular complexes involving dispersion, dipole-induced dipole, dipole–dipole, and hydrogen-bonding interactions, with remarkably good results.},

Illustrative examples include large overestimations of charge-transfer by local and semilocal density functional approximations as well as inaccurate binding energies. It is demonstrated here that standard density functionals fail to accurately describe interaction energies of charge-transfer complexes not only because of the missing long-range exchange as generally assumed but also as a result of the neglect of weak interactions. Thus, accounting for the missing van der Waals interactions is of key importance. These assertions, based on the evaluation of the extent of stabilization due to dispersion using both DFT coupled with our recent density-dependent dispersion correction (dDsC) and high-level ab initio computations, reflect the imperfect error-cancellation between the overestimation of charge-transfer and the missing long-range interactions.

abstract = {The 6-31G and 6-31G basis sets previously introduced for first-row atoms have been extended through the second-row of the periodic table. Equilibrium geometries for one-heavy-atom hydrides calculated for the two-basis sets and using Hartree-Fock wave functions are in good agreement both with each other and with the experimental data. HF/6-31G structures, obtained for two-heavy-atom hydrides and for a variety of hypervalent second-row molecules, are also in excellent accord with experimental equilibrium geometries. No large deviations between calculated and experimental single bond lengths have been noted, in contrast to previous work on analogous first-row compounds, where limiting Hartree-Fock distances were in error by up to a tenth of an angstrom. Equilibrium geometries calculated at the HF/6-31G level are consistently in better agreement with the experimental data than are those previously obtained using the simple split-valance 3-21G basis set for both normal- and hypervalent compounds. Normal-mode vibrational frequencies derived from 6-31G level calculations are consistently larger than the corresponding experimental values, typically by 10{\%}-15{\%}; they are of much more uniform quality than those obtained from the 3-21G basis set. Hydrogenation energies calculated for normal- and hypervalent compounds are in moderate accord with experimental data, although in some instances large errors appear. Calculated energies relating to the stabilities of single and multiple bonds are in much better accord with the experimental energy differences.},

abstract = {Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are important complex carbohydrates that participate in many biological processes through the regulation of their various protein partners. Biochemical, structural biology and molecular modelling approaches have assisted in understanding the molecular basis of such interactions, creating an opportunity to capitalize on the large structural diversity of GAGs in the discovery of new drugs. The complexity of GAG–protein interactions is in part due to the conformational flexibility and underlying sulphation patterns of GAGs, the role of metal ions and the effect of pH on the affinity of binding. Current understanding of the structure of GAGs and their interactions with proteins is here reviewed: the basic structures and functions of GAGs and their proteoglycans, their clinical significance, the three-dimensional features of GAGs, their interactions with proteins and the molecular modelling of heparin binding sites and GAG–protein interactions. This review focuses on some key aspects of GAG structure–function relationships using classical examples that illustrate the specificity of GAG–protein interactions, such as growth factors, anti-thrombin, cytokines and cell adhesion molecules. New approaches to the development of GAG mimetics as possible new glycotherapeutics are also briefly covered.},

The dispersion corrected semi-empirical methods are parameterised against a small training set of 22 complexes having a range of biologically important non-covalent interactions. For the full molecule set (156 complexes), compared to the high-level ab initio database, the mean unsigned errors of the interaction energies at the corrected semi-empirical level are 1.1 (AM1-D) and 1.2 (PM3-D) kcal mol(-1), being a significant improvement over existing AM1 and PM3 methods (8.6 and 8.2 kcal mol(-1)). Importantly, the new semi-empirical methods are capable of describing the diverse range of biological interactions, most notably stacking interactions, which are poorly described by both current AM1 and PM3 methods and by many DFT functionals. The new methods require no more computer time than existing semi-empirical methods and therefore represent an important advance in the study of important biological interactions.},

The origins of the enantioselectivities of this reaction, disclosed by List et al. using a cinchona alkaloid-derived primary amine (cinchona amine) organocatalyst, have been determined with dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT). The stereocontrol hinges on the chair preference of the substrate-enamine intermediate and the conformational preferences of a hydrogen-bonded nine-membered aldol transition state containing eight heavy atoms. The conformations of the hydrogen-bonded ring in the various stereoisomeric transition structures have been analyzed in detail and shown to closely resemble the conformers of cyclooctane. A model of stereoselectivity is proposed for the cinchona amine catalysis of this reaction. The inclusion of Grimme's dispersion corrections in the DFT calculations (B3LYP-D3(BJ)) substantially improves the agreement of the computed energetics and experiment, attesting to the importance of dispersion effects in stereoselectivity.},

The method is based on a second-order expansion of the Kohn-Sham total energy in density-functional theory (DFT) with respect to charge density fluctuations. The zeroth order approach is equivalent to a common standard non-self-consistent (TB) scheme, while at second order a transparent, parameter-free, and readily calculable expression for generalized Hamiltonian matrix elements may be derived. These are modified by a self-consistent redistribution of Mulliken charges (SCC). Besides the usual "band structure" and shea-range repulsive terms the final approximate Kohn-Sham energy additionally includes a Coulomb interaction between charge fluctuations. At large distances this accounts for long-range electrostatic forces between two point charges and approximately includes self-interaction contributions of a given atom if the charges are located at one and the same atom. We apply the new SCC scheme to problems where deficiencies within the non-SCC standard TB approach become obvious. We thus considerably improve transferability.},

abstract = {The ground state structure of C(4N+2) rings is believed to exhibit a geometric transition from angle alternation (N < or = 2) to bond alternation (N > 2). All previous density functional theory (DFT) studies on these molecules have failed to reproduce this behavior by predicting either that the transition occurs at too large a ring size, or that the transition leads to a higher symmetry cumulene. Employing the recently proposed perspective of delocalization error within DFT we rationalize this failure of common density functional approximations (DFAs) and present calculations with the rCAM-B3LYP exchange-correlation functional that show an angle-to-bond-alternation transition between C(10) and C(14). The behavior exemplified here manifests itself more generally as the well known tendency of DFAs to bias toward delocalized electron distributions as favored by Huckel aromaticity, of which the C(4N+2) rings provide a quintessential example. Additional examples are the relative energies of the C(20) bowl, cage, and ring isomers; we show that the results from functionals with minimal delocalization error are in good agreement with CCSD(T) results, in contrast to other commonly used DFAs. An unbiased DFT treatment of electron delocalization is a key for reliable prediction of relative stability and hence the structures of complex molecules where many structure stabilization mechanisms exist.},

High-quality potential energy curves were obtained using coupled-cluster theory with single, double, and perturbative triple substitutions (CCSD(T)) and a large, augmented quadruple-? basis set (aug-cc-pVQZ). The equilibrium intermonomer distance for the hydrogens-down C2v configuration is 3.8 {\AA} with an interaction energy of ?2.74 kcal mol-1. Extrapolating the binding energy to the complete basis set limit gives ?2.81 kcal mol-1. This binding energy is comparable to that of H2O?benzene or of the benzene dimer, and the equilibrium distance is in close agreement with experiment. Other orientations of the dimer were also considered at less complete levels of theory. A considerable reduction in binding for the sulfur-down configuration, together with an energy decomposition analysis, indicates that the attraction in H2S?benzene is best thought of as arising from a favorable electrostatic interaction between partially positive hydrogens in H2S with the negatively charged $\pi$-cloud of the benzene.},

Quantum-mechanical (QM) methods are required for describing chemical reactions and other electronic processes, such as charge transfer or electronic excitation. However, QM methods are restricted to systems of up to a few hundred atoms. However, the size and conformational complexity of biopolymers calls for methods capable of treating up to several 100,000 atoms and allowing for simulations over time scales of tens of nanoseconds. This is achieved by highly efficient, force-field-based molecular mechanics (MM) methods. Thus to model large biomolecules the logical approach is to combine the two techniques and to use a QM method for the chemically active region (e.g., substrates and co-factors in an enzymatic reaction) and an MM treatment for the surroundings (e.g., protein and solvent). The resulting schemes are commonly referred to as combined or hybrid QM/MM methods. They enable the modeling of reactive biomolecular systems at a reasonable computational effort while providing the necessary accuracy.},

abstract = {As the simplest variant of the valence bond (VB) theory, the block-localized wave function (BLW) method defines the intermediate electron-localized state self-consistently at the DFT level and can be used to explore the nature of intermolecular interactions in terms of several physically intuitive energy components. Yet, it is unclear how the dispersion interaction affects such a kind of energy decomposition analysis (EDA) as standard density functional approximations neglect the long-range dispersion attractive interactions. Three electron densities corresponding to the initial electron-localized state, optimal electron-localized state, and final electron-delocalized state are involved in the BLW-ED approach; a density-dependent dispersion correction, such as the recently proposed dDXDM approach, can thus uniquely probe the impact of the long-range dispersion effect on EDA results computed at the DFT level. In this paper, we incorporate the dDXDM dispersion corrections into the BLW-ED approach and investigate a range of representative systems such as hydrogen-bonding systems, acid-base pairs, and van der Waals complexes. Results show that both the polarization and charge-transfer energies are little affected by the inclusion of the long-range dispersion effect, which thus can be regarded as an independent energy component in EDA.},

abstract = {While the attempts currently in progress in several groups for the rigorous inclusion of dispersion interactions in density functional theory (DFT) calculations mature and evolve into practical methodology, we contribute to the debate on the applicability of current functionals to the calculation of weak interaction with a systematic investigation of a few, typical, weakly bound systems. We have used both pure DFT and a hybrid approach in which the total interaction energy is partitioned into two parts: (a) the dispersion energy which, in a first approximation is the contribution due to intermonomer correlations and (b) all other interactions. The first component is accurately obtained at all distances of interest by means of a well-known damped multipolar expansion of the dispersion energy while for the second component different approximations will be evaluated. The need to avoid double counting a fraction of the correlation energy when using the hybrid approach and the choice of the appropriate functional are also discussed. We consider four systems of increasing binding strength, namely the Ar2 and Kr2 dimers, the benzene dimer, the water dimer, and a few metal carbonyls. For pure DFT calculations we confirm the conclusion reached by others concerning (a) the strong dependence of the results on the choice of the GGA functional for dispersion-dominated interaction (noble gases and benzene) with the overall tendency to yield underbinding and (b) the relatively accurate, functional-independent, description for that DFT gives of water, which we attribute to the fact that this system is dominated by electrostatic interactions. For the carbonyls we find that DFT yields results which area again strongly dependent on the choice of the functional and show a tendency to give overbinding. Our hybrid method shows instead shortcomings only for the noble gases. The problem in this case is traceable to the well-known difficulties that all current functionals experience at medium–large intermonomer separations. The quality of the hybrid results improves markedly for benzene due to the large value of both dispersion and repulsive interactions at the equilibrium distance for this dimer, which makes the balance between the two, less delicate. Excellent results are also obtained for water (for the same reason as indicated above) and more significantly for the carbonyls where we find that dispersion contributes to the binding more than it could be guessed a priori. We do not claim to have found a general solution to this difficult problem, but we aim at providing a quantitative assessment to where the problems are pointing at directions from which a general solution may, eventually, emerge. © 2001 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the ground state of an interacting electron gas in an external potential v(r). It is proved that there exists a universal functional of the density, F[n(r)], independent of v(r), such that the expression E≡∫v(r)n(r)dr+F[n(r)] has as its minimum value the correct ground-state energy associated with v(r). The functional F[n(r)] is then discussed for two situations: (1) n(r)=n0+ñ(r), ñ/n0≪1, and (2) n(r)=ϕ(r/r0) with ϕ arbitrary and r0→∞. In both cases F can be expressed entirely in terms of the correlation energy and linear and higher order electronic polarizabilities of a uniform electron gas. This approach also sheds some light on generalized Thomas-Fermi methods and their limitations. Some new extensions of these methods are presented.},

abstract = {Mechanistic pathways for high-temperature rearrangements of 2-ethynylbiphenyl have been investigated by calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory, with free energy estimates at 625 degrees C. Two different routes for high temperature thermal rearrangement can lead to phenanthrene, which was the major product observed by Brown and co-workers (J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1974, 123). 1,2-Hydrogen shift (Hopf type B mechanism) affords a vinylidene which proceeds to the major product by sequential electrocyclic closure and a 1,2-shift, rather than the expected aryl C-H insertion. Alternatively, insertion of the vinylidene into a ring double bond would lead directly to the observed minor product, benzazulene. Along a competitive pathway, electrocyclic closure to an isophenanthrene is predicted to be nearly isoenergetic. This intermediate should have a planar allene structure, with substantial diradical character. Sequential hydrogen shifts lead to phenanthrene but with higher cumulative barriers than for the vinylidene route. Calculation of 625 degrees C free energies shows that the carbene mechanism is of lower energy, primarily because of the lower entropic cost. Predictions are made for the unusually facile hydrogen atom dissociation from isoaromatics at high temperature, a consequence of aryl radical formation. Isophenanthrene, isobenzene (1,2,4-cyclohexatriene) and several isonaphthalenes are also predicted to have unusually low C-H bond dissociation energies. Potential significance as a source of aryl radicals in high temperature and combustion chemistry is discussed.},

abstract = {In previous work we have introduced exact-exchange-based density-functional models of dynamical, nondynamical, and dispersion correlations. We have not yet, however, been able to combine these models into a single energy functional. The problem is that interaction curves in van der Waals complexes are too repulsive. A simple solution is proposed in the present work resulting in an exact-exchange-based energy functional for all chemical interactions, from the weakest (dispersion) to the strongest (molecular bonds).},

We find that S-pi interactions are not random events but rather are the outcome of a competition between the dipolar groups, amides and sulfur-containing, for ring neighbors. This outcome is strongly weighted in favor of S-pi interactions by the presence in the protein of positively charged side-chains; it is not affected by the number of strictly non-polar side-chains.},

Furthermore, PWPB95-D3 is the least basis set dependent and the best functional at the triple-? level. For the example of transition metal carbonyls, it is shown that, mainly due to the lower amount of Fock-exchange, PWPB95-D3 and PTPSS-D3 are better applicable than the other double hybrids. Finally, we discuss in some detail the XYG3 functional [Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009, 106, 4963], which makes use of B3LYP orbitals and electron densities. We show that it is basically a highly nonlocal variant of B2PLYP and that its partially good performance is mainly due to a larger effective amount of perturbative correlation compared to other double hybrids.

abstract = {The development of new organic semiconductors with improved performance in organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) is a major challenge for materials chemists. There is a particular need to develop air-stable n-channel (electron-conducting) organic semiconductors with performance comparable to that of p-channel (hole-conducting) materials, for organic electronics to realize the benefits of complementary circuit design, i.e., the ability to switch transistors with either positive or negative gate voltages. There have been significant advancements in the past five years. In terms of standard OTFT metrics such as the field effect mobility (mu(FET)) and on-to-off current ratio (I-ON/I-OFF), n-channel OTFTs have achieved performance comparable both to that of n-channel amorphous silicon TFTs and to that of the best reported p-channel (hole-conducting) OTFTs; however, issues of device stability linger. This review provides a detailed introduction to OTFTs, summarizes recent progress in the development of new n-channel organic semiconductors, and discusses the critical properties that any prospective n-channel material must have. Methods important to semiconductor design such as electronic structure calculations and synthetic structural modifications are highlighted in a case study of the development of a new n-channel material based on a terthiophene modified with electron-withdrawing groups. The review concludes with a discussion of directions for future work in this area.},

abstract = {The DFTB method is an approximate KS-DFT scheme with an LCAO representation of the KS orbitals, which can be derived within a variational treatment of an approximate KS energy functional. But it may also be related to cellular Wigner-Seitz methods and to the Harris functional. It is an approximate method, but it avoids any empirical parametrization by calculating the Hamiltonian and overlap matrices out of DFT-derived local orbitals (atomic orbitals, AO's). The method includes ab initio concepts in relating the Kohn-Sham orbitals of the atomic configuration to a minimal basis of the localized atomic valence orbitals of the atoms. Consistent with this approximation, the Hamiltonian matrix elements can strictly be restricted to a two-center representation. Taking advantage of the compensation of the so-called "double counting terms" and the nuclear repulsion energy in the DFT total energy expression, the energy may be approximated as a sum of the occupied KS single-particle energies and a repulsive energy, which can be obtained from DFT calculations in properly chosen reference systems. This relates the method to common standard "tight-binding" (TB) schemes, as they are well-known in solid-state physics. This approach defines the density-functional tight-binding (DFTB) method in its original (non-self-consistent) version.},

abstract = {The effect of the linker length (–CH2–) connecting the diene and the dienophile in macrocyclic trienes on their transannular Diels–Alder (TADA) reactivity has been investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The relationship between the conformational properties of these reactants and their reaction energy barriers was examined and a quantitative relationship has been obtained. The transition state energy barriers were found to increase with an increase in the linker length, which is in contrast to the expected trend. The conformational preferences of the triene reactants were studied using replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations. These calculations reveal that longer linkers lead to a decreased probability of the occurrence of conformations with the diene and dienophile parts of the system vicinal to each other, and thus lower reactivity of systems with long linkers. Excellent correlations between the transition state energies and the cumulative probabilities corresponding to a short distance between the reactive sites, along with the ability of the diene to exist in the s-cisoid form, were observed.},

The deviation from the correct intrinsic linear behavior in finite systems leads to delocalization and localization errors in large and bulk systems. Functionals whose energy is convex for fractional charges such as the local density approximation display an incorrect apparent linearity in the bulk limit, due to the delocalization error. Concave functionals also have an incorrect apparent linearity in the bulk calculation, due to the localization error and imposed symmetry. This resolves an apparent paradox and identifies the physical nature of the error to be addressed to obtain accurate band gaps from density functional theory.},

abstract = {The pyranose ring of l-iduronic acid (IdoA), a major constituent of the anticoagulant heparin, is an equilibrium of multiple ring puckers that have evaded quantification by experiment or computation. In order to resolve this enigma, we have calculated the free energy landscape of IdoA and two related monosaccharides from extensive microsecond simulations. After establishing that the simulated puckers had reached equilibrium, hypotheses were confirmed that (a) IdoA 1C4- and 4C1-chair conformations exchange on the microsecond time scale, (b) C5 epimerization leads to a 4C1-chair, and (c) IdoA 2-O-sulfation (IdoA2S) stabilizes the 1C4 conformer. The IdoA and IdoA2S 1C4 conformers were isoenergetic and computed to be 0.9 and 2.6 kcal mol−1 lower in free energy than their respective 4C1-chair conformations. The simulations also predicted that the IdoA 2SO-skew-boat was less populated than previously thought. Novel chemical synthesis and ultra-high-field NMR supported these observations, but slight discrepancies in observed and predicted NMR vicinal couplings implied that the simulation overestimated the population of the IdoA 4C1-chair with respect to 1C4-chair due to small force field inaccuracies that only manifest in long simulations. These free-energy calculations drive improvements in computational methods and provide a novel route to carbohydrate mimetic biomaterials and pharmaceuticals.},

abstract = {We present a new hybrid meta exchange-correlation functional, called M05-2X, for thermochemistry, thermochemical kinetics, and noncovalent interactions. We also provide a full discussion of the new M05 functional, previously presented in a short communication. The M05 functional was parametrized including both metals and nonmetals, whereas M05-2X is a high-nonlocality functional with double the amount of nonlocal exchange (2X) that is parametrized only for nonmetals. In particular, M05 was parametrized against 35 data values, and M05-2X is parametrized against 34 data values. Both functionals, along with 28 other functionals, have been comparatively assessed against 234 data values: the MGAE109/3 main-group atomization energy database, the IP13/3 ionization potential database, the EA13/3 electron affinity database, the HTBH38/4 database of barrier height for hydrogen-transfer reactions, five noncovalent databases, two databases involving metal-metal and metal-ligand bond energies, a dipole moment database, a database of four alkyl bond dissociation energies of alkanes and ethers, and three total energies of one-electron systems. We also tested the new functionals and 12 others for eight hydrogen-bonding and stacking interaction energies in nucleobase pairs, and we tested M05 and M05-2X and 19 other functionals for the geometry, dipole moment, and binding energy of HCN-BF3, which has recently been shown to be a very difficult case for density functional theory. We tested eight functionals for four more alkyl bond dissociation energies, and we tested 12 functionals for several additional bond energies with varying amounts of multireference character. On the basis of all the results for 256 data values in 18 databases in the present study, we recommend M05-2X, M05, PW6B95, PWB6K, and MPWB1K for general-purpose applications in thermochemistry, kinetics, and noncovalent interactions involving nonmetals and we recommend M05 for studies involving both metallic and nonmetallic elements. The M05 functional, essentially uniquely among the functionals with broad applicability to chemistry, also performs well not only for main-group thermochemistry and radical reaction barrier heights but also for transition-metal-transition-metal interactions. The M05-2X functional has the best performance for thermochemical kinetics, noncovalent interactions (especially weak interaction, hydrogen bonding, $\pi$···$\pi$ stacking, and interactions energies of nucleobases), and alkyl bond dissociation energies and the best composite results for energetics, excluding metals.},

abstract = {This Invited Article reports extensions of a recently developed approach to density functional theory with correct long-range behavior (R. Baer and D. Neuhauser, Phys. Rev. Lett., 2005, 94, 043002). The central quantities are a splitting functional gamma[n] and a complementary exchange-correlation functional E[n]. We give a practical method for determining the value of gamma in molecules, assuming an approximation for E is given. The resulting theory shows good ability to reproduce the ionization potentials for various molecules. However it is not of sufficient accuracy for forming a satisfactory framework for studying molecular properties. A somewhat different approach is then adopted, which depends on a density-independent gamma and an additional parameter w eliminating part of the local exchange functional. The values of these two parameters are obtained by best-fitting to experimental atomization energies and bond lengths of the molecules in the G2(1) database. The optimized values are gamma = 0.5 a and w = 0.1. We then examine the performance of this slightly semi-empirical functional for a variety of molecular properties, comparing to related works and experiment. We show that this approach can be used for describing in a satisfactory manner a broad range of molecular properties, be they static or dynamic. Most satisfactory is the ability to describe valence, Rydberg and inter-molecular charge-transfer excitations.},

In the case of the terminal Asp234 residue we observe changes in the binding mode (carboxylate shifts). AIMD dynamics of sufficient duration has allowed us to observe proton transfer from the bridging nucleophile to the catalytically essential Asp 128 residue and to map the underlying free energy surface in terms of simple reaction coordinates, such as the oxygen-oxygen distance Ro-o and the asymmetric stretch delta. This has provided valuable insight into the nature of the last step of the catalytic cycle. In addition, constrained molecular dynamics permitted us to compare the deprotonation free energy of the bridging nucleophile in the case of native versus metal-depleted arginase.},

Phys. 131, 224104 (2009)], which is a first-principles alternative to empirical dispersion corrections in density functional theory, is implemented with generalized multicenter interactions involving both atomic and atomic pair polarizabilities. The generalization improves the asymptote of intermolecular interactions, reducing the mean absolute percentage error from about 30{\%} to 6{\%} in the molecular C(6) coefficients of more than 1000 dimers, compared to experimental values. The method is also applied to calculations of potential energy curves of molecules in the S22 database [P. Jure{\v{c}}ka et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 8, 1985 (2006)]. The calculated potential energy curves are in a good agreement with reliable benchmarks recently published by Molnar et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 131, 065102 (2009)]. These improvements are achieved at the price of increasing complexity in the implementation, but without losing the computational efficiency of the previous two-center (atom-atom) formulation. A set of different truncations of two-center and three- or four-center interactions is shown to be optimal in the cost-performance balance.},

By calculating vertical excitation energies of typical molecules, it was found that LC-TDDFT gives accurate excitation energies, within an error of 0.5 eV, and reasonable oscillator strengths, while TDDFT employing a pure functional provides 1.5 eV lower excitation energies and two orders of magnitude lower oscillator strengths for the Rydberg excitations. It was also found that LC-TDDFT clearly reproduces the correct asymptotic behavior of the charge-transfer excitation energy of ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene dimer for the long intramolecular distance, unlike a conventional far-nucleus asymptotic correction scheme. It is, therefore, presumed that poor TDDFT results for pure functionals may be due to their lack of a long-range orbital-orbital interaction.},

The formalism is based on the assumption that charge transport occurs by hopping through a Gaussian manifold of states with superimposed positional disorder. Key parameters of the model are the width of the density-of-hopping states and the degree of positional disorder. The width of the hopping site manifold increases with increasing dipole moment. This results in a sharp decrease in mobility with increasing dipole moment. The origin of this effect has been attributed to random internal fields associated with the dipole moments. The positional disorder has been attributed to packing constraints.},

abstract = {The framework of ab initio density-functional theory (DFT) has been introduced as a way to provide a seamless connection between the Kohn-Sham (KS) formulation of DFT and wave-function based ab initio approaches [R. J. Bartlett, I. Grabowski, S. Hirata, and S. Ivanov, J. Chem. Phys. 122, 034104 (2005)]. Recently, an analysis of the impact of dynamical correlation effects on the density of the neon atom was presented [K. Jankowski, K. Nowakowski, I. Grabowski, and J. Wasilewski, J. Chem. Phys. 130, 164102 (2009)], contrasting the behaviour for a variety of standard density functionals with that of ab initio approaches based on second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset (MP2) and coupled cluster theories at the singles-doubles (CCSD) and singles-doubles perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] levels. In the present work, we consider ab initio density functionals based on second-order many-body perturbation theory and coupled cluster perturbation theory in a similar manner, for a range of small atomic and molecular systems. For comparison, we also consider results obtained from MP2, CCSD, and CCSD(T) calculations. In addition to this density based analysis, we determine the KS correlation potentials corresponding to these densities and compare them with those obtained for a range of ab initio density functionals via the optimized effective potential method. The correlation energies, densities, and potentials calculated using ab initio DFT display a similar systematic behaviour to those derived from electronic densities calculated using ab initio wave function theories. In contrast, typical explicit density functionals for the correlation energy, such as VWN5 and LYP, do not show behaviour consistent with this picture of dynamical correlation, although they may provide some degree of correction for already erroneous explicitly density-dependent exchange-only functionals. The results presented here using orbital dependent ab initio density functionals show that they provide a treatment of exchange and correlation contributions within the KS framework that is more consistent with traditional ab initio wave function based methods.},

abstract = {Van der Waals (vdW) interactions are ubiquitous in molecules and condensed matter, and play a crucial role in determining the structure, stability, and function for a wide variety of systems. The accurate prediction of these interactions from first principles is a substantial challenge because they are inherently quantum mechanical phenomena that arise from correlations between many electrons within a given molecular system. We introduce an efficient method that accurately describes the nonadditive many-body vdW energy contributions arising from interactions that cannot be modeled by an effective pairwise approach, and demonstrate that such contributions can significantly exceed the energy of thermal fluctuations—a critical accuracy threshold highly coveted during molecular simulations—in the prediction of several relevant properties. Cases studied include the binding affinity of ellipticine, a DNA-intercalating anticancer agent, the relative energetics between the A- and B-conformations of DNA, and the thermodynamic stability among competing paracetamol molecular crystal polymorphs. Our findings suggest that inclusion of the many-body vdW energy is essential for achieving chemical accuracy and therefore must be accounted for in molecular simulations.},

The new functional is considerably simpler than its predecessors of a similar type. The functional has a tractable and robust analytic form that lends itself to efficient self-consistent implementation. When paired with an appropriate exchange functional, our nonlocal correlation model yields accurate interaction energies of weakly-bound complexes, not only near the energy minima but also far from equilibrium. Our model exhibits an outstanding precision at predicting equilibrium intermonomer separations in van der Waals complexes. It also gives accurate covalent bond lengths and atomization energies. Hence the functional proposed in this work is a computationally inexpensive electronic structure tool of broad applicability.},

The methods tested include MP2, MP3, SCS-MP2, SCS(MI)-MP2, MP2.5, MP2.X, MP2C, DFT-D, DFT-D3 (B3-LYP-D3, B-LYP-D3, TPSS-D3, PW6B95-D3, M06-2X-D3), and M06-2X, and semiempirical methods augmented with dispersion and hydrogen bonding corrections: SCC-DFTB-D, PM6-D, PM6-DH2, and PM6-D3H4. The test complexes are the octadecane dimer, the guanine trimer, the circumcoronene···adenine dimer, the coronene dimer, the guanine-cytosine dimer, the circumcoronene···guanine-cytosine dimer, and an amyloid fragment trimer containing phenylalanine residues. The best performing method is MP2.5 with relative root-mean-square deviation (rRMSD) of 4{\%}. It can thus be recommended as an alternative to the CCSD(T)/CBS (alternatively QCISD(T)/CBS) benchmark for molecular systems which exceed current computational capacity. The second best non-DFT method is MP2C with rRMSD of 8{\%}. A method with the most favorable ?accuracy/cost? ratio belongs to the DFT family: BLYP-D3, with an rRMSD of 8{\%}. Semiempirical methods deliver less accurate results (the rRMSD exceeds 25{\%}). Nevertheless, their absolute errors are close to some much more expensive methods, such as M06-2X, MP2, or SCS(MI)-MP2, and thus their price/performance ratio is excellent.},

The method bypasses the poor scaling with system size of standard replica exchange and thus reduces the number of replicas (parallel processes) that must be used. This reduction is accomplished by deforming the Hamiltonian function for each replica in such a way that the acceptance probability for the exchange of replica configurations does not depend on the number of explicit water molecules in the system. For proof of concept, REST is compared with standard replica exchange for an alanine dipeptide molecule in water. The comparisons confirm that REST greatly reduces the number of CPUs required by regular replica exchange and increases the sampling efficiency. This method reduces the CPU time required for calculating thermodynamic averages and for the ab initio folding of proteins in explicit water.},

However, B3LYP is not able to reliably model systems in which noncovalent interactions are important. Here we present a method that corrects this deficiency in B3LYP by using dispersion-correcting potentials (DCPs). DCPs are utilized by simple modifications to input files and can be used in any computational package that can read effective-core potentials. Therefore, the technique requires no programming. DCPs (developed for H, C, N, and O) produce the best results when used in conjunction with 6-31+G(2d,2p) basis sets. The B3LYP-DCP approach was tested on the S66, S22, and HSG-A benchmark sets of noncovalently interacting dimers and trimers and was found to, on average, significantly outperform almost all other DFT-based methods that were designed to treat van der Waals interactions. Users of B3LYP who wish to model systems in which noncovalent interactions (viz., steric repulsion, hydrogen bonding, $\pi$-stacking) are present, should consider B3LYP-DCP.},

This makes it a general-purpose functional whose domain of applicability has been extended to transition states, rather than a specialized functional for kinetics. The improvement in BMK rests on the inclusion of the kinetic energy density together with a large value of the exact exchange mixing coefficient. For this functional, the kinetic energy density appears to correct "back" the excess exact exchange mixing for ground-state properties, possibly simulating variable exchange.},

abstract = {A new hybrid density functional for general chemistry applications is proposed. It is based on a mixing of standard generalized gradient approximations (GGAs) for exchange by Becke (B) and for correlation by Lee, Yang, and Parr (LYP) with Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange and a perturbative second-order correlation part (PT2) that is obtained from the Kohn-Sham (GGA) orbitals and eigenvalues. This virtual orbital-dependent functional contains only two global parameters that describe the mixture of HF and GGA exchange (a(x)) and of the PT2 and GGA correlation (c), respectively. The parameters are obtained in a least-squares-fit procedure to the G297 set of heat of formations. Opposed to conventional hybrid functionals, the optimum a(x) is found to be quite large (53{\%} with c=27{\%}) which at least in part explains the success for many problematic molecular systems compared to conventional approaches. The performance of the new functional termed B2-PLYP is assessed by the G297 standard benchmark set, a second test suite of atoms, molecules, and reactions that are considered as electronically very difficult (including transition-metal compounds, weakly bonded complexes, and reaction barriers) and comparisons with other hybrid functionals of GGA and meta-GGA types. According to many realistic tests, B2-PLYP can be regarded as the best general purpose density functional for molecules (e.g., a mean absolute deviation for the two test sets of only 1.8 and 3.2 kcal/mol compared to about 3 and 5 kcal/mol, respectively, for the best other density functionals). Very importantly, also the maximum and minimum errors (outliers) are strongly reduced (by about 10-20 kcal/mol). Furthermore, very good results are obtained for transition state barriers but unlike previous attempts at such a good description, this definitely comes not at the expense of equilibrium properties. Preliminary calculations of the equilibrium bond lengths and harmonic vibrational frequencies for diatomic molecules and transition-metal complexes also show very promising results. The uniformity with which B2-PLYP improves for a wide range of chemical systems emphasizes the need of (virtual) orbital-dependent terms that describe nonlocal electron correlation in accurate exchange-correlation functionals. From a practical point of view, the new functional seems to be very robust and it is thus suggested as an efficient quantum chemical method of general purpose.},

abstract = {The van der Waals volume is a widely used descriptor in modeling physicochemical properties. However, the calculation of the van der Waals volume (V(vdW)) is rather time-consuming, from Bondi group contributions, for a large data set. A new method for calculating van der Waals volume has been developed, based on Bondi radii. The method, termed Atomic and Bond Contributions of van der Waals volume (VABC), is very simple and fast. The only information needed for calculating VABC is atomic contributions and the number of atoms, bonds, and rings. Then, the van der Waals volume (A(3)/molecule) can be calculated from the following formula: V(vdW) = summation operator all atom contributions - 5.92N(B) - 14.7R(A) - 3.8R(NR) (N(B) is the number of bonds, R(A) is the number of aromatic rings, and R(NA) is the number of nonaromatic rings). The number of bonds present (N(B)) can be simply calculated by N(B) = N - 1 + R(A) + R(NA) (where N is the total number of atoms). A simple Excel spread sheet has been made to calculate van der Waals volumes for a wide range of 677 organic compounds, including 237 drug compounds. The results show that the van der Waals volumes calculated from VABC are equivalent to the computer-calculated van der Waals volumes for organic compounds.},

We demonstrate that the substitution of quaterthiophene with dispersion-driven aggregators (e.g., [7]ladderanes, hydrogenated pyrenes, etc.) leads to the formation of highly stable and tightly packed 1-D supramolecular assemblies with electronic compactness superior to that of quaterthiophene crystals. Tunability and even tighter stacking arrangements can be achieved by inserting molecular linkers between the quaterthiophene fragments and the dispersion-driven components.

abstract = {The trifluoromethyl substituent has been incorporated into quinidine as a conformational stabilizer and a probe to provide straightforward insight into the conformational behavior of cinchona alkaloids. By significantly decreasing the rotation rate of the quinoline-carbinol bond, the relatively bulky CF(3) group enables the NMR signals of the syn and anti conformers to be differentiated at room temperature. In addition to the stabilizing effect, the introduction of the fluorinated moiety also facilitates the application of (19)F NMR spectroscopy, thereby allowing conformational studies under various conditions without the use of deuterated solvents.},

abstract = {With recent advances in electronic structure methods, first-principles calculations of electronic response properties, such as linear and nonlinear polarizabilities, have become possible for molecules with more than 100 atoms. Basis set incompleteness is typically the main source of error in such calculations since traditional diffuse augmented basis sets are too costly to use or suffer from near linear dependence. To address this problem, we construct the first comprehensive set of property-optimized augmented basis sets for elements H–Rn except lanthanides. The new basis sets build on the Karlsruhe segmented contracted basis sets of split-valence to quadruple-zeta valence quality and add a small number of moderately diffuse basis functions. The exponents are determined variationally by maximization of atomic Hartree–Fock polarizabilities using analytical derivative methods. The performance of the resulting basis sets is assessed using a set of 313 molecular static Hartree–Fock polarizabilities. The mean absolute basis set errors are 3.6{\%}, 1.1{\%}, and 0.3{\%} for property-optimized basis sets of split-valence, triple-zeta, and quadruple-zeta valence quality, respectively. Density functional and second-order M{\o}ller–Plesset polarizabilities show similar basis set convergence. We demonstrate the efficiency of our basis sets by computing static polarizabilities of icosahedral fullerenes up to C720 using hybrid density functional theory.},

Theoretical methods can be used to describe surface chemical reactions in detail and to understand variations in catalytic activity from one catalyst to another. Here, we review the first steps towards using computational methods to design new catalysts. Examples include screening for catalysts with increased activity and catalysts with improved selectivity. We discuss how, in the future, such methods may be used to engineer the electronic structure of the active surface by changing its composition and structure.},

As for Ga–Kr, first-order spin–orbit corrections are included explicitly in the G2 energies of K- and Ca-containing atoms and molecules. In contrast to the procedure for Ga–Kr, the 3s and 3p orbitals need to be included in the correlation space for K- and Ca-containing molecules. The geometries obtained with the new basis sets are in satisfactory agreement with experiment. Assessment of the thermochemical predictions is limited because of the sparsity of accurate experimental data for molecules containing K and Ca. Ionization energies are generally in good agreement with experimental values, as are the atomization energies for K-containing molecules. However, there are larger differences between theoretical and experimental atomization energies for Ca-containing molecules.},

The calculated interaction energies of the parallel and perpendicular thiophene dimers are ?1.71 and ?3.12 kcal/mol, respectively. The substantial attractive interaction in the thiophene dimer, even where the molecules are well separated, shows that the major source of attraction is not short-range interactions such as charge transfer but rather long-range interactions such as electrostatic and dispersion. The inclusion of electron correlation increases the attraction significantly. The dispersion interaction is found to be the major source of attraction in the thiophene dimer. The calculated total interaction energy of the thiophene dimer is highly orientation dependent. Although electrostatic interaction is substantially weaker than dispersion interaction, it is highly orientation dependent, and therefore electrostatic interaction play an important role in the orientation dependence of the total interaction energy. The large attractive interaction in the perpendicular dimer is the cause of the preference for the herringbone structure in the crystals of nonsubstituted oligothiophenes ($\alpha$-terthienyls), and the steric repulsion between the ?-substituents is the cause of the $\pi$-stacked structure in the crystals of some ?-substituted oligothiophenes.

abstract = {In the exact theory, the ground state energy of an open system varies linearly when the electron number is changed between two adjacent integers. This linear dependence is not reproduced by common approximate density functionals. Deviation from linearity in this dependence has been suggested as a basis for the concept of many-electron self-interaction error (SIE). In this paper, we quantify many-electron SIE of a number of approximations by performing calculations on fractionally charged atoms. We demonstrate the direct relevance of these studies to such problems of common approximate functionals as instabilities of anions, spurious fractional charges on dissociated atoms, and poor description of charge transfer. Semilocal approximations have the largest many-electron SIE, which is only slightly reduced in typical global hybrids. In these approximations the energy versus fractional electron number curves upward, while in Hartree-Fock theory the energy curves downward. Perdew-Zunger self-interaction correction [Phys. Rev. B 23, 5048 (1981)] significantly reduces the many-electron SIE of semilocal functionals but impairs their accuracy for equilibrium properties. In contrast, a long-range corrected hybrid functional can be nearly many-electron SIE-free in many cases (for reasons we discuss) and at the same time performs remarkably well for many molecular properties.},

Some of these relative displacements lead to improved cofacial orbital overlaps that are otherwise inaccessible due to Pauli repulsion. Our results also emphasize that the fine-tuning of in-plane displacements is more effective than achieving "tighter" packing to promote charge-transfer properties.},

abstract = {Silica is the main component of the Earth's crust and is also of great relevance in many branches of materials science and technology. Its phase diagram is rather intricate and exhibits many different crystalline phases. The reported propensity to amorphization and the strong influence on the outcome of the initial structure and of the pressurization protocol indicate the presence of metastability and large kinetic barriers. As a consequence, theory is also faced with great difficulties and our understanding of the complex transformation mechanisms is still very sketchy despite a large number of simulations. Here, we introduce a substantial improvement of the metadynamics method, which finally brings simulations in close agreement with experiments. We unveil the subtle and non-intuitive stepwise mechanism of the pressure-induced transformation of fourfold-coordinated alpha-quartz into sixfold-coordinated stishovite at room temperature. We also predict that on compression fourfold-coordinated coesite will transform into the post-stishovite alpha-PbO2-type phase. The new method is far more efficient than previous methods, and for the first time the study of complex structural phase transitions with many intermediates is within the reach of molecular dynamics simulations. This insight will help in designing new experimental protocols capable of steering the system towards the desired transition.},

abstract = {Significant differences in amylase, beta-glucosidase, and phosphatase activities were observed among four Phytophthora cinnamomi isolates grown in nutrient-amended sterilized soil for 20 days. Amylase pH optima for the four isolates were within a relatively narrow range; at pH 5.5 each isolate was within 90{\%} of its peak activity. Isolates SB-216-1, 1-281, and C-39 each exhibited maximal beta-glucosidase activity at pH 5.0 and maximal phosphatase activity at pH 5.0-5.5. Maximal activity for these two enzymes of isolate A-7725 occurred at pH 3.5. In timed experiments, isolates 1-281 and A-7725 exhibited greater amylase activities than did the other two isolates. For beta-glucosidase, greatest activity was observed for SB-216-1; ACTivity of 1-281 was intermediate and least activity was observed for isolates A-7725 and C-39. Isolates SB-216-1 and 1-281 exhibited greatest phosphatase activities; isolate C-39 was intermediate in activity, and A-7725 was least active. Results indicate that significant differences exist among the isolates tested and that these differences can be quantitatively measured by the methods described.},

abstract = {The LCAO, or Bloch, or tight binding, approximation for solids is discussed as an interpolation method, to be used in connection with more accurate calculations made by the cellular or orthogonalized plane-wave methods. It is proposed that the various integrals be obtained as disposable constants, so that the tight binding method will agree with accurate calculations at symmetry points in the Brillouin zone for which these calculations have been made, and that the LCAO method then be used for making calculations throughout the Brillouin zone. A general discussion of the method is given, including tables of matrix components of energy for simple cubic, face-centered and body-centered cubic, and diamond structures. Applications are given to the results of Fletcher and Wohlfarth on Ni, and Howarth on Cu, as illustrations of the fcc case. In discussing the bcc case, the splitting of the energy bands in chromium by an antiferromagnetic alternating potential is worked out, as well as a distribution of energy states for the case of no antiferromagnetism. For diamond, comparisons are made with the calculations of Herman, using the orthogonalized plane-wave method. The case of such crystals as InSb is discussed, and it is shown that their properties fit in with the energy band picture.},

abstract = {Understanding protein folding is one of the most challenging problems remaining in molecular biology. In this chapter, a highly parallel replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) method and its application to protein folding are described. The REMD method couples molecular dynamics trajectories with a temperature exchange Monte Carlo process for efficient sampling of the conformational space. A series of replicas are run in parallel at temperatures ranging from the desired temperature to a high temperature at which the replica can easily surmount the energy barriers. From time to time the configurations of neighboring replicas are exchanged and this exchange is accepted or rejected based on a Metropolis acceptance criterion that guarantees the detailed balance. Two example protein systems, one alpha-helix and one beta-hairpin, are used as case studies to demonstrate the power of the algorithm. Up to 64 replicas of solvated protein systems are simulated in parallel over a wide range of temperatures. The simulation results show that the combined trajectories in temperature and configurational space allow a replica to overcome free energy barriers present at low temperatures. These large-scale simulations also reveal detailed results on folding mechanisms, intermediate state structures, thermodynamic properties, and the temperature dependences for both protein systems.},

abstract = {I present a new Markov chain sampling method appropriate for distributions with isolated modes. Like the recently-developed method of ``simulated tempering'', the ``tempered transition'' method uses a series of distributions that interpolate between the distribution of interest and a distribution for which sampling is easier. The new method has the advantage that it does not require approximate values for the normalizing constants of these distributions, which are needed for simulated tempering, and can be tedious to estimate. Simulated tempering performs a random walk along the series of distributions used. In contrast, the tempered transitions of the new method move systematically from the desired distribution, to the easily-sampled distribution, and back to the desired distribution. This systematic movement avoids the inefficiency of a random walk, an advantage that unfortunately is cancelled by an increase in the number of interpolating distributions required. Because of this, the sampling efficiency of the tempered transition method in simple problems is similar to that of simulated tempering. On more complex distributions, however, simulated tempering and tempered transitions may perform differently. Which is better depends on the ways in which the interpolating distributions are ``deceptive''.},

abstract = {The reactivity of intermediates in palladium-catalyzed allylic alkylation was investigated using DFT (B3LYP) calculations including a PB-SCRF solvation model. In the presence of both phosphine and chloride ligands, the allyl intermediate is in equilibrium between a cationic eta(3)-allylPd complex with two phosphine ligands, the corresponding neutral complex with one phosphine and one chloride ligand, and a neutral eta(1)-allylPd complex with one chloride and two phosphine ligands. The eta(1)-complex is unreactive toward nucleophiles. The cationic eta(3)-complex is the intermediate most frequently invoked in the title reaction, but in the presence of halides, the neutral, unsymmetrically substituted eta(3)-complex will be formed rapidly from anionic Pd(0) complexes in solution. Since the latter will prefer both leaving group ionization and reaction with nucleophiles in the position trans to phosphorus, it can rationalize the observed "memory effect" (a regioretention) in the title reaction, even in the absence of chiral ligands.},

@article{Livshits2008,
abstract = {It has been known for quite some time that approximate density functional (ADF) theories fail disastrously when describing the dissociative symmetric radical cations R(2)(+). By considering this dissociation limit, previous work has shown that Hartree-Fock (HF) theory favors the R(+1)-R(0) charge distribution, whereas DF approximations favor the R(+0.5)-R(+0.5). Yet, general quantum mechanical principles indicate that both these (as well as all intermediate) average charge distributions are asymptotically energy degenerate. Thus, HF and ADF theories mistakenly break the symmetry but in a contradicting way. In this letter, we show how to construct system-dependent long-range corrected (LC) density functionals that can successfully treat this class of molecules, avoiding the spurious symmetry breaking. Examples and comparisons to experimental data is given for R = H, He, and Ne, and it is shown that the new LC theory improves considerably the theoretical description of the R(2)(+) bond properties, the long-range form of the asymptotic potential curve, and the atomic polarizability. The broader impact of this finding is discussed as well, and it is argued that the widespread semiempirical approach which advocates treating the LC parameter as a system-independent parameter is in fact inappropriate under general circumstances.},

We demonstrate that the substitution of quaterthiophene with dispersion-driven aggregators (e.g., [7]ladderanes, hydrogenated pyrenes, etc.) leads to the formation of highly stable and tightly packed 1-D supramolecular assemblies with electronic compactness superior to that of quaterthiophene crystals.

abstract = {Polarization functions are added in two steps to a split-valence extended gaussian basis set: d-type gaussians on the first row atoms C, N, O and F and p-type gaussians on hydrogen. The same d-exponent of 0.8 is found to be satisfactory for these four atoms and the hydrogen p-exponent of 1.1 is adequate in their hydrides. The energy lowering due to d functions is found to depend on the local symmetry around the heavy atom. For the particular basis used, the energy lowerings due to d functions for various environments around the heavy atom are tabulated. These bases are then applied to a set of molecules containing up to two heavy atoms to obtain their LCAO-MO-SCF energies. The mean absolute deviation between theory and experiment (where available) for heats of hydrogenation of closed shell species with two non-hydrogen atoms is 4 kcal/mole for the basis set with full polarization. Estimates of hydrogenation energy errors at the Hartree-Fock limit, based on available calculations, are given.},

abstract = {We discuss the description of water and hydration effects that employs an approximate density functional theory, DFTB3, in either a full QM or QM/MM framework. The goal is to explore, with the current formulation of DFTB3, the performance of this method for treating water in different chemical environments, the magnitude and nature of changes required to improve its performance, and factors that dictate its applicability to reactions in the condensed phase in a QM/MM framework. A relatively minor change (on the scale of kBT) in the O-H repulsive potential is observed to substantially improve the structural properties of bulk water under ambient conditions; modest improvements are also seen in dynamic properties of bulk water. This simple change also improves the description of protonated water clusters, a solvated proton, and to a more limited degree, a solvated hydroxide. By comparing results from DFTB3 models that differ in the description of water, we confirm that proton transfer energetics are adequately described by the standard DFTB3/3OB model for meaningful mechanistic analyses. For QM/MM applications, a robust parametrization of QM-MM interactions requires an explicit consideration of condensed phase properties, for which an efficient sampling technique was developed recently and is reviewed here. The discussions help make clear the value and limitations of DFTB3 based simulations, as well as the developments needed to further improve the accuracy and transferability of the methodology.},

Here we apply Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics simulations with explicit inclusion of water molecules to investigate the reaction pathway for the anionic bond formation of siliceous oligomers. The rates of SiO-Si bond formation of linear or ring containing silicate oligomers become substantially enhanced, compared to gas phase results. The formation of 3-ring oligomer is more favorable than the formation of higher branched and ring silica oligomers.},

It is shown that for strongly bound ionic hydrogen-bonded complexes, like OH − –H 2 O , hybrid approaches provide accurate results. For other systems, including the water dimer, the DFT calculations fail to reproduce the correct angular dependence of the potential surfaces. It is also shown that a hybrid functional adjusted to reproduce the CCSD(T) value of the binding energy for the water dimer produces results worse than the standard hybrid functionals for OH − –H 2 O , and fails to describe the correct anisotropy of the CO–H 2 O interaction.},

@article{Grimme2004,
abstract = {An empirical method to account for van der Waals interactions in practical calculations with the density functional theory (termed DFT-D) is tested for a wide variety of molecular complexes. As in previous schemes, the dispersive energy is described by damped interatomic potentials of the form C6R(-6). The use of pure, gradient-corrected density functionals (BLYP and PBE), together with the resolution-of-the-identity (RI) approximation for the Coulomb operator, allows very efficient computations for large systems. Opposed to previous work, extended AO basis sets of polarized TZV or QZV quality are employed, which reduces the basis set superposition error to a negligible extend. By using a global scaling factor for the atomic C6 coefficients, the functional dependence of the results could be strongly reduced. The "double counting" of correlation effects for strongly bound complexes is found to be insignificant if steep damping functions are employed. The method is applied to a total of 29 complexes of atoms and small molecules (Ne, CH4, NH3, H2O, CH3F, N2, F2, formic acid, ethene, and ethine) with each other and with benzene, to benzene, naphthalene, pyrene, and coronene dimers, the naphthalene trimer, coronene. H2O and four H-bonded and stacked DNA base pairs (AT and GC). In almost all cases, very good agreement with reliable theoretical or experimental results for binding energies and intermolecular distances is obtained. For stacked aromatic systems and the important base pairs, the DFT-D-BLYP model seems to be even superior to standard MP2 treatments that systematically overbind. The good results obtained suggest the approach as a practical tool to describe the properties of many important van der Waals systems in chemistry. Furthermore, the DFT-D data may either be used to calibrate much simpler (e.g., force-field) potentials or the optimized structures can be used as input for more accurate ab initio calculations of the interaction energies.},

abstract = {The standard approach to ab initio simulations of activated chemical processes is based on the harmonic-oscillator/rigid-rotor approximation to transition state theory. However, there is increasing evidence that these approximations fail for reactions involving loosely bound reactant and/or transitions states where entropy makes a significant contribution to the free-energy reaction barrier. Examples are provided by the conversion (proton exchange, dehydrogenation, monomolecular cracking) of short alkanes over acidic zeolites. For proton exchange and monomolecular cracking the reaction path may be described reasonably well by simple vectorial reaction coordinates and the free energy of activation may be derived by free-energy integration schemes such as the Blue-Moon ensemble technique in combination with constrained ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. For alkane dehydrogenation, however, several reaction scenarios are in competition and techniques such as transition-path sampling must be used to determine the dominant reaction mechanism. In our paper we describe the fundamental aspects of these techniques and discuss their application to compute free-energy barriers for proton exchange between isobutane and acidic chabazite and for monomolecular cracking of propane. Dehydrogenation of propane has been studied using transition-path sampling. In this case the static approach based on harmonic transition state theory not only fails in producing accurate reaction barriers but even leads to incorrect predictions of reaction intermediates and products.},

abstract = {Intermolecular interactions are of great importance in chemistry but are difficult to model accurately with computational methods. In particular, Hartree-Fock and standard density-functional approximations do not include the physics necessary to properly describe dispersion. These methods are sometimes corrected to account for dispersion by adding a pairwise C6R6 term, with C6 dispersion coefficients dependent on the atoms involved. We present a post-Hartree-Fock model in which C6 coefficients are generated by the instantaneous dipole moment of the exchange hole. This model relies on occupied orbitals only, and involves only one, universal, empirical parameter to limit the dispersion energy at small interatomic separations. The model is extensively tested on isotropic C6 coefficients of 178 intermolecular pairs. It is also applied to the calculation of the geometries and binding energies of 20 intermolecular complexes involving dispersion, dipole-induced dipole, dipole-dipole, and hydrogen-bonding interactions, with remarkably good results.},

abstract = {InCl(3) and other In(III) species have been widely applied as catalysts in many reactions. However, what are the real catalytic species of these reactions? Through DFT calculations and experimental investigation of the mechanism and regioselectivity of InCl(3)-catalyzed cycloisomerization reactions of 1,6-enynes (here all discussed 1,6-enynes are ene-internal-alkyne molecules), we propose that the catalytic species of this reaction is the in situ generated InCl(2)(+). Further electrospray ionization high-resolution mass spectroscopy (ESI-HRMS) supported the existence of InCl(2)(+) in acetonitrile solution. This finding of InCl(2)(+) as the catalytic species suggests that other reactions catalyzed by In(III) species could also have cationic In(III) species as the real catalysts. DFT calculations revealed that the catalytic cycle of the cycloisomerization of 1,6-enynes catalyzed by InCl(3) starts from InCl(2)(+) coordination to the alkyne of the substrate, generating a vinyl cation. Then nonclassical cyclopropanation of the vinyl cation to the alkene part of the substrate gives a homoallylic cation, which undergoes a novel homoallylic cation rearrangement involving a [1,3]-carbon shift to give the more stable homoallylic cation 15. Finally InCl(2)(+) cation coordination assisted nonconjugated [1,2]-hydride shifts deliver the final nonconjugated diene products. The preference of generating nonconjugated dienes instead of conjugated dienes in the cycloisomerization reaction is mainly due to two reasons: coordination of the InCl(2)(+) to the alkene part in [1,2]-H shift transition states disfavors the conjugated [1,2]-H shifts that generate cations adjacent to the positively charged alkene, and coordination of InCl(2)(+) to the nonconjugated diene product is stronger than coordination to the conjugated diene, making nonconjugated [1,2]-H shift transition states lower in energy than conjugated [1,2]-H shift transition states, on the basis of the Hammond postulate. DFT calculations predicted that the conjugated [1,2]-H shifts could become favored if the electron-donating methyl substituent in the alkyne moiety of the 1,6-enyne is replaced by a H atom. This prediction of producing a conjugated diene has been verified experimentally. Rationalization about why type II rather than type I products were obtained using InCl(3) as the catalyst in the cycloisomerization of 1,6-enynes has also been investigated computationally.},

abstract = {Using a newly developed and recently parameterized classical empirical simulation model for water that involves explicit three-body interactions, we determine the eleven most stable isomers of the water hexamer. We find that the lowest energy isomer is one of the cage structures, in agreement with far-IR and microwave experiments. The energy ordering for the binding energies is cage > glove > book > bag > chair > boat > chaise, and energies relative to the cage are in good agreement with CCSD(T) calculations. The three-body contributions to the cage, book, and chair are also in reasonable agreement with CCSD(T) results. The energy of each isomer results from a delicate balance involving the number of hydrogen bonds, the strain of these hydrogen bonds, and cooperative and anti-cooperative three-body interactions, whose contribution we can understand simply from the form of the three-body interactions in the simulation model. Oxygen-oxygen distances in the cage and book isomers are in good agreement with microwave experiments. Hydrogen-bond distances depend on both donor and acceptor, which can again be understood from the three-body model. Fully anharmonic OH-stretch spectra are calculated for these low-energy structures, and compared with shifted harmonic results from ab initio and density functional theory calculations. Replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulations were performed from 40 to 194 K, which show that the cage isomer has the lowest free energy from 0 to 70 K, and the book isomer has the lowest free energy from 70 to 194 K. OH-stretch spectra were calculated between 40 and 194 K, and results at 40, 63, and 79 K were compared to recent experiments, leading to re-assignment of the peaks in the experimental spectra. We calculate local OH-stretch cumulative spectral densities for different donor-acceptor types and compare to analogous results for liquid water.},

abstract = {Computational studies of organic systems are frequently limited to static pictures that closely align with textbook style presentations of reaction mechanisms and isomerization processes. Of course, in reality chemical systems are dynamic entities where a multitude of molecular conformations exists on incredibly complex potential energy surfaces (PES). Here, we borrow a computational technique originally conceived to be used in the context of biological simulations, together with empirical force fields, and apply it to organic chemical problems. Replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) permits thorough exploration of the PES. We combined REMD with density functional tight binding (DFTB), thereby establishing the level of accuracy necessary to analyze small molecular systems. Through the study of four prototypical problems: isomer identification, reaction mechanisms, temperature-dependent rotational processes, and catalysis, we reveal new insights and chemistry that likely would be missed using static electronic structure computations. The REMD-DFTB methodology at the heart of this study is powered by i-PI, which efficiently handles the interface between the DFTB and REMD codes.},

abstract = {A set of 148 molecules having well-established enthalpies of formation at 298 K is presented. This set, referred to as the G2 neutral test set, includes the 55 molecules whose atomization energies were used to test Gaussian-2 (G2) theory [J. Chem. Phys. 94, 7221 (1991)] and 93 new molecules. The G2 test set includes 29 radicals, 35 nonhydrogen systems, 22 hydrocarbons, 47 substituted hydrocarbons, and 15 inorganic hydrides. It is hoped that this new test set will provide a means for assessing and improving new theoretical models. From an assessment of G2 and density functional theories(DFT) on this test set it is found that G2 theory is the most reliable method both in terms of average absolute deviation (1.58 kcal/mol) and maximum deviation (8.2 kcal/mol). The largest deviations between experiment and G2 theory occur for molecules having multiple halogens. Inclusion of spin–orbit effects reduces the average absolute deviation to 1.47 kcal/mol and significantly improves the results for the chlorine substituted molecules, but little overall improvement is seen for the fluorine substituted molecules. Of the two modified versions of G2 theory examined in this study, G2(MP2,SVP) theory (average absolute deviation=1.93 kcal/mol) performs better than G2(MP2) theory (2.04 kcal/mol). The G2(MP2,SVP) theory is found to perform very well for hydrocarbons, radicals, and inorganic hydrides. Of the seven DFT methods investigated, the B3LYP method has the smallest average absolute deviation (3.11 kcal/mol). It also has a significantly larger distribution of error than the G2 methods with a maximum deviation of 20.1 kcal/mol.},

The local-density approximation, the Perdew-Wang 1991 generalized-gradient approximation, and the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized-gradient approximation are utilized in the calculation of equilibrium bond lengths, atomization energies, and anharmonic and harmonic vibrational frequencies. We also use the density-functional-based determination of atomic polarizabilities and ionization potentials to obtain the coefficients for the long-range (1/r6) attraction. Our calculations suggest that the interaction from the overlap of atomic densities is the primary binding mechanism in these systems at short range but that the long-range 1/r6 attraction could also contribute to the total binding energy.},

Brown's SN2/SN1 "dissociative" mechanism, of SN2 formation of borane-ether adducts followed by SN1 alkene attack, was at odds with Pasto's original SN2/SN2 hypothesis, and while Brown could prove his mechanism for a variety of cases, he could not perform the experimental test with THF adducts in THF solvent, where the higher THF concentrations might favor an SN2 second step. Two diboranes were tested: B2H6, used by Pasto, and (9BBN)2 (9BBN = 9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane, C8H15B), used by Brown. The new entropy terms resulted in improved accuracy vs traditional techniques (∼2 kcal mol(-1)), but this accuracy was not sufficient to resolve the mechanism in the Pasto case.},

abstract = {Self-assembled supramolecular organic liquid crystal structures at nanoscale have potential applications in molecular electronics, photonics, and porous nanomaterials. Most of these structures are formed by aggregation of soft spherical supramolecules, which have soft coronas and overlap each other in the packing process. Our main focus here is to study the possible packing mechanisms via molecular dynamics simulations at the atomistic level. We consider the relative stability of various lattices packed by the soft dendrimer balls, first synthesized and characterized by Percec et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997, 119, 1539) with different packing methods. The dendrons, which form the soft dendrimer balls, have the character of a hard aromatic region from the point of the cone to the edge with C(12) alkane "hair". After the dendrons pack into a sphere, the core of the sphere has the hard aromatic groups, while the surface is covered with the C(12) alkane "hair". In our studies, we propose three ways to organize the hair on the balls, Smooth/Valentino balls, Sticky/Einstein balls, and Asymmetric/Punk balls, which lead to three different packing mechanisms, Slippery, Sticky, and Anisotropic, respectively. We carry out a series of molecular dynamics (MD) studies on three plausible crystal structures (A15, FCC, and BCC) as a function of density and analyze the MD based on the vibrational density of state (DoS) method to extract the enthalpy, entropy, and free energies of these systems. We find that anisotropic packed A15 is favored over FCC, BCC lattices. Our predicted X-ray intensities of the best structures are in excellent agreement with experiment. "Anisotropic ball packing" proposed here plays an intermediate role between the enthalpy-favored "disk packing" and entropy-favored "isotropic ball packing", which explains the phase transitions at different temperatures. Free energies of various lattices at different densities are essentially the same, indicating that the preferred lattice is not determined during the packing process. Both enthalpy and entropy decrease as the density increases. Free energy change with volume shows two stable phases: the condensed phase and the isolated micelle phase. The interactions between the soft dendrimer balls are found to be lattice dependent when described by a two-body potential because the soft ball self-adjusts its shape and interaction in different lattices. The shape of the free energy potential is similar to that of the "square shoulder potential". A model explaining the packing efficiency of ideal soft balls in various lattices is proposed in terms of geometrical consideration.},

We employ here a combination of mechanistic probes, including the observation of intermediates, the independent generation and partitioning of intermediates, thermodynamic and kinetic measurements on the main reaction and side reactions, isotopic incorporation from solvent, and kinetic isotope effects, to define the mechanism and an experimental mechanistic free-energy profile for a prototypical Morita Baylis-Hillman reaction in methanol. The results are then used to critically evaluate the ability of computations to predict the mechanism. The most notable prediction of the many computational studies, that of a proton-shuttle pathway, is refuted in favor of a simple but computationally intractable acid-base mechanism. Computational predictions vary vastly, and it is not clear that any significant accurate information that was not already apparent from experiment could have been garnered from computations. With care, entropy calculations are only a minor contributor to the larger computational error, while literature entropy-correction processes lead to absurd free-energy predictions. The computations aid in interpreting observations but fail utterly as a replacement for experiment.},

abstract = {It is of general concern whether the automated structure prediction of unknown material without recourse to any knowledge from experiment is ever possible considering the daunting complexity of potential energy surface (PES) of material. Here we demonstrate that the stochastic surface walking (SSW) method can be a general and promising solution to this ultimate goal, which is applied to assemble carbon fullerenes containing up to 100 atoms (including 60, 70, 76, 78, 80, 84, 90, 96, and 100 atoms) from randomly distributed atoms, a long-standing challenge in global optimization. Combining the SSW method with a parallel replica exchange algorithm, we can locate the global minima (GM) of these large fullerenes efficiently without being trapped in numerous energy-nearly degenerate isomers. Detailed analyses on the SSW trajectories allow us to rationalize how and why the SSW method is able to explore the highly complex PES, which highlights the abilities of SSW method for surmounting the high barrier and the preference of SSW trajectories to the low energy pathways. The work demonstrates that the parallel SSW method is a practical tool for predicting unknown materials.

The inclusion of Coulomb-attenuated exchange in the functional is facilitated by use of the adiabatic connection coupled with a short-range and long-range splittings. The new functionals have a good performance on thermochemistry and a much improved description of the total energy versus number of electrons and henceforth a much smaller many-electron self-interaction error.},

abstract = {The invention of the transistor almost 50 years ago was one of the most important technical developments of this century. It has had profound impact on the way we live and the way we work. The first part of this paper covers the events that led to the discovery of the transistor effect and the invention of the point contact transistor in December of 1947. It continues with the development of the theory of the junction transistor in early 1948 and the fabrication of the first grown junction transistor in 1950. It is fair to say that this event completed the invention of the transistor and developed a fundamental understanding of how it worked. The second part of the paper describes the major hurdles that had to be overcome and the major breakthroughs that had to be made to turn an exciting invention into a far reaching technical innovation. This phase took approximately another 10 years. By that time, high performance, high reliability transistors could be manufactured in large quantity and at low cost. Importantly the foundation had been laid for the invention of the integrated circuit and the dramatic development of the microelectronics industry. The final part of the paper suggests some of the reasons why such an important technological innovation could occur in a relatively short period of time and be such an unqualified success. Finally, there are some comments on how much further this technology can go and when its rapid progress may come to an end},

The semiempirical Hamiltonian with the D3 correction can accurately and efficiently model both solid- and gas-phase inter- and intramolecular interactions at a speed up of 2 orders of magnitude compared to DFT-D. The mean absolute deviations for interaction (lattice) energies for various databases are typically 2?3 kcal/mol (10?20{\%}), that is, only about two times larger than those for DFT-D.

abstract = {Theory and implementation of the analytical nuclear gradient is presented for orbital optimized scaled opposite-spin perturbation theory (O2). Evaluation of the O2 analytical gradient scales with the 4th power of molecular size, like the O2 energy. Since the O2 method permits optimization of the orbitals in the presence of wavefunction-based electron correlation, it is suitable for problems where correlation effects determine the competition between localization and delocalization of an odd electron, or hole. One such problem is the description of a neutral soliton defect on an all-trans polyacetylene chain with an odd number of carbon atoms. We show that the results of the O2 method compare well to benchmark values for small polyenyl radicals. O2 is also efficient enough to be applied to longer chains where benchmark coupled cluster methods are unfeasible. For C(41)H(43), unrestricted orbital O2 calculations yield a soliton length of about 9 carbon atoms, while other unrestricted orbital methods such as Hartree-Fock, and the B3LYP and $\omega$B97X-D density functionals, delocalize the soliton defect over the entire chain. The O2 result is about half the width inferred experimentally.},

To continue to progress toward the quality of results demanded by today's ab initio quantum chemistry encourages a new direction. We believe ab initio DFT is a promising route to pursue. Whereas conventional DFT cannot describe weak interactions, photoelectron spectra, or many potential energy surfaces, ab initio DFT, even in its initial, optimized effective potential, second-order many-body perturbation theory form [OEP (2)-semi canonical], is shown to do all well. In fact, we obtain accuracy that frequently exceeds MP2, being competitive with coupled-cluster theory in some cases. Furthermore, this is accomplished within a relatively fast computational procedure that scales like iterative second order. We illustrate our results with several molecular examples including Ne2,Be2,F2, and benzene.},

abstract = {Recent developments in path integral methodology have significantly reduced the computational expense of including quantum mechanical effects in the nuclear motion in ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. However, the implementation of these developments requires a considerable programming effort, which has hindered their adoption. Here we describe i-PI, an interface written in Python that has been designed to minimise the effort required to bring state-of-the-art path integral techniques to an electronic structure program. While it is best suited to first principles calculations and path integral molecular dynamics, i-PI can also be used to perform classical molecular dynamics simulations, and can just as easily be interfaced with an empirical forcefield code. To give just one example of the many potential applications of the interface, we use it in conjunction with the CP2K electronic structure package to showcase the importance of nuclear quantum effects in high-pressure water. PROGRAM SUMMARY Program title: i-PI Catalogue identifier: AERN{\_}v1{\_}0 Program summary URL: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AERN{\_}v1{\_}0.html Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen’s University, Belfast, N. Ireland Licensing provisions: GNU General Public License, version 3 No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 138626 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 3128618 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: Python. Computer: Multiple architectures. Operating system: Linux, Mac OSX, Windows. RAM: Less than 256 Mb Classification: 7.7. External routines: NumPy Nature of problem: Bringing the latest developments in the modelling of nuclear quantum effects with path integral molecular dynamics to ab initio electronic structure programs with minimal implementational effort. Solution method: State-of-the-art path integral molecular dynamics techniques are implemented in a Python interface. Any electronic structure code can be patched to receive the atomic coordinates from the Python interface, and to return the forces and energy that are used to integrate the equations of motion. Restrictions: This code only deals with distinguishable particles. It does not include fermonic or bosonic exchanges between equivalent nuclei, which can become important at very low temperatures. Running time: Depends dramatically on the nature of the simulation being performed. A few minutes for short tests with empirical force fields, up to several weeks for production calculations with ab initio forces. The examples provided with the code run in less than an hour.},

Lett. 314, 141 (1999)] based on properties of the numerical integrators in the underlying isothermal molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We show that a variety of deterministic algorithms favored by molecular dynamics practitioners for constant-temperature simulation of biomolecules fail either to be measure invariant or irreducible, and are therefore not ergodic. We then show that REMD using these algorithms also fails to be ergodic. As a result, the entire configuration space may not be explored even in an infinitely long simulation, and the simulation may not converge to the desired equilibrium Boltzmann ensemble. Moreover, our analysis shows that for initial configurations with unfavorable energy, it may be impossible for the system to reach a region surrounding the minimum energy configuration. We demonstrate these failures of REMD algorithms for three small systems: a Gaussian distribution (simple harmonic oscillator dynamics), a bimodal mixture of Gaussians distribution, and the alanine dipeptide. Examination of the resulting phase plots and equilibrium configuration densities indicates significant errors in the ensemble generated by REMD simulation. We describe a simple modification to address these failures based on a stochastic hybrid Monte Carlo correction, and prove that this is ergodic.},

DW CNT is also the simplest model of multi-wall (MW) carbon nanotube. In this study, we have simulated DW NTs with not only commensurate (6, 6)@(11, 11) and (10, 0)@(19, 0) morphologies (analogously to those double-wall carbon nanotubes studied so far), but also incommensurate (6, 6)@(19, 0) and (10,0)@(11, 11) ones, all described by asymmetric P1 rod group. Inter-shell distances in aforementioned nanotubes are changed from 3.37 to 3.54 angstrom, within the interval of DW CNT stability. Due to essential difference between the translation periods of SW CNTs with (n(1), n(1)) and (n(2), 0) chirality indices (their ratio is 1/root 3), we have been able to use the first-principles DFT-LCAO method only for detailed calculations on the first two nanotube configurations mentioned above (using unit cell model), while the semi-empirical self-consistent-charge density-functional tight-binding (SCC-DFTB) method has been applied for calculations of all four DW NT configurations (in the framework of super-cell model characterized by large translation length unit of incommensurate double-wall nanotube achieving 4.24 nm). Combining both methods for calculations on SW and DW CNTs, we have analyzed their electronic properties (e.g., band structure, density of states as well as electronic charge redistribution).},

Particular attention is focused on soluble semiconductors for organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). The hitherto differentiation between "small molecules" and polymeric materials no longer plays a role, rather more the ability to process materials from solution to homogeneous semiconducting films with optimal electronic properties (high charge-carrier mobility, low threshold voltage, high on/off ratio) is pivotal. Key classes of materials for this purpose are soluble oligoacenes, soluble oligo- and polythiophenes and their respective copolymers, and oligo- and polytriarylamines. In this context, micro- or nanocrystalline materials have the general advantage of somewhat higher charge-carrier mobilities, which, however, could be offset in the case of amorphous, glassy materials by simpler and more reproducible processing.},

abstract = {At room temperature, 1,2-hydrogen-transfer reactions of N-heterocyclic carbenes, like the imidazol-2-ylidene to give imidazole is shown to occurr almost entirely (>90 {\%}) by quantum mechanical tunneling (QMT). At 60 K in an Ar matrix, for the 2, 3-dihydrothiazol-2-ylidene→thiazole transformation, QMT is shown to increase the rate about 10(5)  times. Calculations including small-curvature tunneling show that the barrier for intermolecular 1,2-hydrogen-transfer reaction is small, and QMT leads to a reduced rate of the forward reaction because of nonclassical reflections even at room temperature. A small barrier also leads to smaller kinetic isotope effects because of efficient QMT by both H and D. QMT does not always lead to faster reactions or larger KIE values, particularly when the barrier is small.},

abstract = {Analytical formulation of the second-order geometrical derivatives of energy for the self-consistent-charge density-functional tight-binding (SCC-DFTB) method is presented. To test its quality and numerical performance, the derived formalism has been coded and applied for calculation of harmonic vibrational frequencies for a set of 17 small and medium size molecules. For this set, the average absolute deviation from experiment is 99 cm−1 for SCC-DFTB vs 62 cm−1 for the M{\o}ller-Plesset second-order perturbation theory with the cc-pVDZ basis set (MP2/cc-pVDZ) and 32 cm−1 for the B3LYP density functional method with the same basis set (B3LYP/cc-pVDZ), while the maximal deviation is 465 cm−1 vs 1741 cm−1 for MP2/cc-pVDZ and 112 cm−1 for B3LYP/cc-pVDZ. The SCC-DFTB results are in reasonable agreement with experiments as well as with ab initio and density-functional results, and are better than other semiempirical methods. The SCC-DFTB method allows for considerable computational time saving when compared to other methods while retaining similar overall accuracy. Data for a series of conjugated polyenes show that an analytical formulation of SCC-DFTB is noticeably faster than its numerical formulation.},

abstract = {With increasing availability of good all‐electron LCAO MO (LCAO molecular orbital) wave functions for molecules, a systematic procedure for obtaining maximum insight from such data has become desirable. An analysis in quantitative form is given here in terms of breakdowns of the electronic population into partial and total ``gross atomic populations,{\&}apos;{\&}apos; or into partial and total ``net atomic populations{\&}apos;{\&}apos; together with ``overlap populations.{\&}apos;{\&}apos; ``Gross atomic populations{\&}apos;{\&}apos; distribute the electrons almost perfectly among the various AOs (atomic orbitals) of the various atoms in the molecule. From these numbers, a definite figure is obtained for the amount of promotion (e.g., from 2s to 2p) in each atom; and also for the gross charge Q on each atom if the bonds are polar. The total overlap population for any pair of atoms in a molecule is in general made up of positive and negative contributions. If the total overlap population between two atoms is positive, they are bonded; if negative, they are antibonded. Tables of gross atomic populations and overlap populations, also gross atomic charges Q, computed from SCF (self‐consistent field) LCAO‐MO data on CO and H2O, are given. The amount of s‐p promotion is found to be nearly the same for the O atom in CO and in H2O (0.14 electron in CO and 0.15e in H2O). For the C atom in CO it is 0.50e. For the N atom in N2 it is 0.26e according to calculations by Scherr. In spite of very strong polarity in the $\pi$ bonds in CO, the $\sigma$ and $\pi$ overlap populations are very similar to those in N2. In CO the total overlap population for the $\pi$ electrons is about twice that for the $\sigma$ electrons. The most easily ionized electrons of CO are in an MO such that its gross atomic population is 94{\%} localized on the carbon atom; these electrons account for the (weak) electron donor properties of CO. A comparison between changes of bond lengths observed on removal of an electron from one or another MO of CO and H2, and corresponding changes in computed overlap populations, shows good correlation. Several other points of interest are discussed.},

@article{Allen2002,
abstract = {The dispersion interaction in the helium dimer is considered from the viewpoint of the force on a nucleus. At large internuclear separations, Brueckner coupled cluster BD(T) forces agree well with near-exact dispersion forces. The atomic density distortion associated with the dispersion force is quantified by comparing the BD(T) dimer density with a superposition of atomic densities. For density functional theory calculations in the Hartree–Fock–Kohn–Sham (HFKS) formalism, the accuracy of the dispersion force is governed by the correlation potential. Calculations using the conventional Lee–Yang–Parr [Phys. Rev. B 37, 785 (1988)] potential only generate a small density distortion, giving forces significantly smaller than BD(T). The BD(T) electron densities are therefore used to determine improved correlation potentials using a modified Zhao–Morrison–Parr (ZMP) approach [Phys. Rev. A 50, 2138 (1994)]. HFKS calculations using these ZMP potentials quantitatively reproduce the distortion, giving dispersion forces in good agreement with BD(T). The dimer ZMP correlation potential is partitioned into two parts, one equal to the sum of two unperturbed spherical atomic correlation potentials and the other representing an interaction potential. HFKS calculations using the former do not generate the distortion; forces are close to Hartree–Fock. Calculations using the latter do generate the distortion, giving forces essentially identical to those from the full dimer potential. The origin of the distortion is traced to the asymmetric structure of the interaction correlation potential in the vicinity of each nucleus.},

abstract = {We report a novel scheme for computing electronic excitation energies within the framework of density functional theory (DFT) based on a time-independent variational formulation of DFT. The excited state density functional is recast as a Kohn?Sham functional, which is further simplified by an adiabatic approximation of the exchange-correlation functional. Under the adiabatic approximation, the minimization of the excited state Kohn?Sham functional is shown to be equivalent to a ground state DFT computation augmented with orthogonality constraints with respect to the ground state Kohn?Sham determinant. An algorithm for the optimization of the energy subject to orthogonality constraints, which does not suffer from variational collapse, is described and implemented. A benchmark test set containing 28 organic molecules ( Schreiber, M. J. Chem. Phys. 2008, 128, 134110 ) was used to assess the quality of the excitation energies obtained. Two novel approaches to spin-adapt the resulting excitation energies are discussed and found to provide results with error metrics similar to those of time-dependent DFT. Similarities and differences with respect to other time-independent DFT approaches are highlighted and some of the advantages of our scheme?including the ability to correctly describe charge-transfer excitations?are critically assessed.},

abstract = {Charge carrier dynamics in an organic semiconductor can often be described in terms of charge hopping between localized states. The hopping rates depend on electronic coupling elements, reorganization energies, and driving forces, which vary as a function of position and orientation of the molecules. The exact evaluation of these contributions in a molecular assembly is computationally prohibitive. Various, often semiempirical, approximations are employed instead. In this work, we review some of these approaches and introduce a software toolkit which implements them. The purpose of the toolkit is to simplify the workflow for charge transport simulations, provide a uniform error control for the methods and a flexible platform for their development, and eventually allow in silico prescreening of organic semiconductors for specific applications. All implemented methods are illustrated by studying charge transport in amorphous films of tris-(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminum, a common organic semiconductor.},

abstract = {Density functional calculations are reported for charge-transfer complexes (CT), also called electron donor?acceptor systems, formed from ethylene or ammonia interacting with a halogen molecule (C2H4···X2, NH3···X2, X = F, Cl, Br, and I). In all cases, the local density approximation provides a strong overestimation of the intermolecular interaction. The generalized gradient approximation moves the results in the right direction but, in general, not nearly far enough; large errors remain. We attribute the problem to the too rapid asymptotic decay of the exchange?correlation potential associated with the imperfect cancellation of the self-interaction. This breakdown of the potential is reflected in a set of incorrect eigenvalues (orbital electronegativities) that play a crucial role in governing the charge transfer and, hence, the interaction energy. The inclusion of some Hartree?Fock exchange using hybrid methods provides a large improvement, and the parameters related to the intermolecular interaction for the so-called half-and-half potential are in very good agreement with those obtained through second-order M?ller?Plesset calculations and with available experimental data. However, the more widely used three-parameter, B3LYP, functional does not perform well; the hybrid methods are not a panacea. Density functional calculations are reported for charge-transfer complexes (CT), also called electron donor?acceptor systems, formed from ethylene or ammonia interacting with a halogen molecule (C2H4···X2, NH3···X2, X = F, Cl, Br, and I). In all cases, the local density approximation provides a strong overestimation of the intermolecular interaction. The generalized gradient approximation moves the results in the right direction but, in general, not nearly far enough; large errors remain. We attribute the problem to the too rapid asymptotic decay of the exchange?correlation potential associated with the imperfect cancellation of the self-interaction. This breakdown of the potential is reflected in a set of incorrect eigenvalues (orbital electronegativities) that play a crucial role in governing the charge transfer and, hence, the interaction energy.

abstract = {Motivated by the protein structure prediction problem, we develop two variants of the Hamiltonian replica exchange methods (REMs) for efficient configuration sampling, (1) the scaled hydrophobicity REM and (2) the phantom chain REM, and compare their performance with the ordinary REM. We first point out that the ordinary REM has a shortage for the application to large systems such as biomolecules and that the Hamiltonian REM, an alternative formulation of the REM, can give a remedy for it. We then propose two examples of the Hamiltonian REM that are suitable for a coarse-grained protein model. (1) The scaled hydrophobicity REM prepares replicas that are characterized by various strengths of hydrophobic interaction. The strongest interaction that mimics aqueous solution environment makes proteins folding, while weakened hydrophobicity unfolds proteins as in organic solvent. Exchange between these environments enables proteins to escape from misfolded traps and accelerate conformational search. This resembles the roles of molecular chaperone that assist proteins to fold in vivo. (2) The phantom chain REM uses replicas that allow various degrees of atomic overlaps. By allowing atomic overlap in some of replicas, the peptide chain can cross over itself, which can accelerate conformation sampling. Using a coarse-gained model we developed, we compute equilibrium probability distributions for poly-alanine 16-mer and for a small protein by these REMs and compare the accuracy of the results. We see that the scaled hydrophobicity REM is the most efficient method among the three REMs studied. © 2002 American Institute of Physics. © 2002 American Institute of Physics},

By mixing conformational sampling at constant pH (with discrete protonation states) with a temperature ladder, this method avoids conformational trapping. Our method was tested and applied to seven different biological systems. The constant pH REMD not only predicted pKa correctly for small, model compounds but also converged faster than constant pH molecular dynamics (MD). We further tested our constant pH REMD on a heptapeptide from ovomucoid third domain (OMTKY3).

abstract = {The first proton transport step following photon absorption in bacteriorhodopsin is from the 13-cis retinal Schiff base to Asp85. Configurational and energetic determinants of this step are investigated here by performing quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical minimum-energy reaction-path calculations. The results suggest that retinal can pump protons when in the 13-cis, 15-anti conformation but not when 13-cis, 15-syn. Decomposition of the proton transfer energy profiles for various possible pathways reveals a conflict between the effect of the intrinsic proton affinities of the Schiff base and Asp85, which favors the neutral, product state (i.e., with Asp85 protonated), with the mainly electrostatic interaction between the protein environment with the reacting partners, which favors the ion pair reactant state (i.e., with retinal protonated). The rate-limiting proton-transfer barrier depends both on the relative orientations of the proton donor and acceptor groups and on the pathway followed by the proton; depending on these factors, the barrier may arise from breaking and forming of hydrogen bonds involving the Schiff base, Asp85, Asp212, and water w402, and from nonbonded interactions involving protein groups that respond to the charge rearrangements in the Schiff base region.},

abstract = {We consider a general class of hybrid density functionals with decomposition of the exchange component into short-range and long-range parts. The admixture of Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange is controlled by three parameters: short-range mixing, long-range mixing, and range separation. We study how the variation of these parameters affects the accuracy of hybrid functionals for thermochemistry and kinetics. For the density functional component of the hybrids, we test three nonempirical approximations: local spin-density approximation, generalized gradient approximation (GGA), and meta-GGA. We find a great degree of flexibility in choosing the mixing parameters in range-separated hybrids. For the studied properties, short-range and long-range HF exchange seem to have a similar effect on the errors. One may choose to treat the long-range portion of the exchange by HF to recover the correct asymptotic behavior of the exchange potential and improve the description of density tail regions. If this asymptote is not important, as in solids, one may use screened hybrids, where long-range HF exchange is excluded. Screened hybrids retain most of the benefits of global hybrids but significantly reduce the computational cost in extended systems.},

abstract = {The interactions within two models for graphene, coronene and hexabenzocoronene (HBC), and (H 3C(CH 2) 5) 6-HBC, a synthesizable model for asphaltenes, were studied using density functional theory (DFT) with dispersion corrections. The corrections were implemented using carbon atom-centered effective core-type potentials that were designed to correct the erroneous long-range behavior of several DFT methods. The potentials can be used with any computational chemistry program package that can handle standard effective core potential input, without the need for software modification. Testing on a set of common noncovalently bonded dimers shows that the potentials improve calculated binding energies by factors of 2-3 over those obtained without the potentials. Binding energies are predicted to within ca. 15{\%}, and monomer separations to within ca. 0.1 A, of high-level wave function data. The application of the present approach predicts binding energies and structures of the coronene dimer that are in excellent agreement with the results of other DFT methods in which dispersion is taken into account. Dimers of HBC show extensive binding in pi-stacking arrangements, with the largest binding energy, 44.8 kcal/mol, obtained for a parallel-displaced structure. This structure is inline with the published crystal structure. Conformations in which the monomers are perpendicular to one another are much more weakly bound and have binding energies less than 10 kcal/mol. For dimers of (H 3C(CH 2) 5) 6-HBC, which contain 336 atoms, we find that a slipped-parallel structure with C s symmetry has a binding energy of 52.4 kcal/mol, 8.9 kcal/mol lower than that of a bowl-like, C 6 v -symmetric structure.},

abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) lack a stable tertiary structure, but their short binding regions termed Pre-Structured Motifs (PreSMo) can form transient secondary structure elements in solution. Although disordered proteins are crucial in many biological processes and designing strategies to modulate their function is highly important, both experimental and computational tools to describe their conformational ensembles and the initial steps of folding are sparse. Here we report that discrete molecular dynamics (DMD) simulations combined with replica exchange (RX) method efficiently samples the conformational space and detects regions populating $\alpha$-helical conformational states in disordered protein regions. While the available computational methods predict secondary structural propensities in IDPs based on the observation of protein-protein interactions, our ab initio method rests on physical principles of protein folding and dynamics. We show that RX-DMD predicts $\alpha$-PreSMos with high confidence confirmed by comparison to experimental NMR data. Moreover, the method also can dissect $\alpha$-PreSMos in close vicinity to each other and indicate helix stability. Importantly, simulations with disordered regions forming helices in X-ray structures of complexes indicate that a preformed helix is frequently the binding element itself, while in other cases it may have a role in initiating the binding process.

abstract = {Recent applications of density functional theory to biologically relevant metal centers are reviewed. The emphasis is on reaction mechanisms, structures, and modeling. The accuracy of different functionals is discussed for standard benchmark tests of first- and second-row molecules and for transition metal systems. Modeling aspects of the protein metal complexes are discussed regarding both the size of the model being treated quantum mechanically and the treatment of the protein surrounding it. To illustrate the effects, structures computed without the effects of the protein are compared with experimental structures from enzymes, and results from simple dielectric models of the protein for electron transfer processes are described. The choice of spin state is discussed for multimetal complexes. Examples of mechanisms studied recently by density functional theory are described, such as O2 and methane activation in methane monooxygenase and O2 formation in photosystem II.},

In particular, the water hexamer is the smallest cluster that possesses several nearly iso-energetic non-planar isomeric forms whose relative stability at low temperatures can be probed experimentally and investigated theoretically. Here, we report on the equilibrium populations of the isomers in the temperature range from 30K to 150K for both H2O and D2O as predicted by four different water potentials. The simulations, performed using path-integral molecular dynamics combined with the replica exchange method, highlight some deficiencies of empirical water models while providing support for the accuracy of more recent ab initio-based potentials. The theoretical predictions for the cage/prism isomeric equilibrium upon isotopic substitution suggest that rotational spectra measured for the deuterated cluster could deliver further insights on the ground-state properties of the water hexamer.},

abstract = {<p><br/>The anionic polysaccharides heparin and heparan sulphate play essential roles in the regulation of many physiological processes. Heparin is often used as an analogue for heparan sulphate. Despite knowledge of an NMR solution structure and 19 crystal structures of heparin-protein complexes for short heparin fragments, no structures for larger heparin fragments have been reported up to now. Here, we show that solution structures for six purified heparin fragments dp6-dp36 (where dp stands for degree of polymerisation) can be determined by a combination of analytical ultracentrifugation, synchrotron X-ray scattering, and constrained modelling. Analytical ultracentrifugation velocity data for dp6-dp36 showed sedimentation coefficients that increased linearly from 1.09 S to 1.84 S with size. X-ray scattering of dp6-dp36 gave radii of gyration RG that ranged from 1.33 nm to 3.12 nm and maximum lengths that ranged from 3.0 nm to 12.3 nm. The higher resolution of X-ray scattering revealed an increased bending of heparin with increased size. Constrained molecular modelling of 5000 randomised heparin conformers resulted in 9-15 best-fit structures for each of dp18, dp24, dp30, and dp36 that indicated flexibility and the presence of short linear segments in mildly bent structures. Comparisons of these solution structures with crystal structures of heparin-protein complexes revealed similar ranges of phi ([phi]) and psi ([psi]) angles between iduronate and glucosamine rings. We conclude that heparin in solution has a semi-rigid and extended conformation that is preformed for its optimal binding to protein targets without major conformational changes.</p>},

abstract = {The conformational behavior and infrared spectrum of l-phenylalanine were studied by matrix-isolation infrared spectroscopy and DFT [B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p)] calculations. The fourteen most stable structures were predicted to differ in energy by less than 10 kJ mol(-1), eight of them with abundances higher than 5{\%} at the temperature of evaporation of the compound (423 K). Experimental results suggest that six conformers contribute to the spectrum of the isolated compound, whereas two conformers (IIb(3) and IIIb(3)) relax in matrix to a more stable form (IIb(2)) due to low energy barriers for conformational isomerization (conformational cooling). The two lowest-energy conformers (Ib(1), Ia) differ only in the arrangement of the amino acid group relative to the phenyl ring; they exhibit a relatively strong stabilizing intramolecular hydrogen bond of the O-H...N type and the carboxylic group in the trans configuration (O=C-O-H dihedral angle ca. 180 degrees ). Type II conformers have a weaker H-bond of the N-H...O=C type, but they bear the more favorable cis arrangement of the carboxylic group. Being considerably more flexible, type II conformers are stabilized by entropy and the relative abundances of two conformers of this type (IIb(2) and IIc(1)) are shown to significantly increase with temperature due to entropic stabilization. At 423 K, these conformers are found to be the first and third most abundant species present in the conformational equilibrium, with relative populations of ca. 15{\%} each, whereas their populations could be expected to be only ca. 5{\%} if entropy effects were not taken into consideration. Indeed, phenylalanine can be considered a notable example of a molecule where entropy plays an essential role in determining the relative abundance of the possible low-energy conformational states and then, the thermodynamics of the compound, even at moderate temperatures. Upon UV irradiation (lambda > 235 nm) of the matrix-isolated compound, unimolecular photodecomposition of phenylalanine is observed with production of CO(2) and phenethylamine.},

abstract = {Semiclassical Marcus electron transfer theory is often employed to investigate the charge transport properties of organic semiconductors. However, quite often the electronic couplings vary several orders of magnitude in organic crystals, which goes beyond the application scope of semiclassical Marcus theory with the first-order perturbative nature. In this work, we employ a generalized nonadiabatic transition state theory (GNTST) [ Zhao et al., J. Phys. Chem. A 110, 8204 (2004) ], which can evaluate the charge transfer rates from weak to strong couplings, to study charge transport properties in prototypical organic semiconductors: quaterthiophene and sexithiophene single crystals. By comparing with GNTST results, we find that the semiclassical Marcus theory is valid for the case of the coupling <10 meV for quaterthiophene and <5 meV for sexithiophene. It is shown that the present approach can be applied to design organic semiconductors with general electronic coupling terms. Taking oligothiophenes as examples, we find that our GNTST-calculated hole mobility is about three times as large as that from the semiclassical Marcus theory. The difference arises from the quantum nuclear tunneling and the nonperturbative effects.},

abstract = {Quantum chemical molecular dynamics have been employed to investigate the healing of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) during growth. In trajectories based on self-consistent-charge density-functional tight-binding (SCC-DFTB) energies and gradients, gas-phase carbon atoms were supplied to the carbon?iron boundary of a model C40-Fe38 complex at two different rates (1 C/0.5 ps and 1 C/10 ps). The lower rate of carbon supply was observed to promote SWNT growth, compared to the higher rate, for the same number of carbon atoms supplied. This promotion of growth was ascribed to the suppression of pentagon and heptagon incorporation in the sp2 carbon network observed at lower carbon supply rates. The most successful example of growth occurred when the respective periods of hexagon and pentagon formation were out of phase and heptagon formation was limited. Higher carbon supply rates tended to result in the encapsulation of the Fe38 cluster by the extended sp2 carbon cap, due to a saturation of pentagon and heptagon defects in the latter. The greater tendency toward hexagon formation found using a lower carbon supply rate was attributed to the relative rates of defect removal and addition from the sp2 carbon cap during the growth process. The defect removal (i.e., healing) process of the sp2 carbon cap occurred via ring isomerization, which resulted in the removal of 5-7, adatom, and monovacancy defects. These healing mechanisms generally occurred over time scales of several picoseconds and depended largely on the presence of the catalyst surface. The healing mechanisms observed in this work represent a possible pathway by which control over the (n, m) chirality of a nascent SWNT is obtained during the growth process.},

However, the last decade has seen a surge of enthusiasm in the DFT community to tackle this problem and in so-doing to extend the applicability of DFT-based methods. Here we discuss, classify, and evaluate some of the promising schemes to emerge in recent years.

abstract = {Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using a MPWB1K functional to interpret the charge transport (CT) properties of stacked annelated $\beta$-trithiophene molecules. The goal was to help understand how the chemical composition, face-to-face stacking, intra- and intermolecular correlations, and the applied electric field affect the CT properties of this organic semiconductor compared with those of the edge-to-face "herringbone" motif. The variations in the frontier molecular orbitals, energy gap, nonadiabatic electron attachment energies (EAE), and vertical detachment energies (VDE) were investigated under an external electric field as a function of the number of stacked layers (n). Two possible CT pathways, monomer-to-monomer (MM) and dimer-to-dimer (DD) transports, were postulated to determine the charge carrier conductivities of these molecules. The results highlight that the intermolecular electronic couplings and electrostatic interactions can significantly affect the stacking geometry, even in more extended structures; displaced stacks with smaller interlayer spacing resulted in more compact stacking and, thus, higher CT efficiency; face-to-face stacking geometries can help to reduce the energy gap and VDE. Despite the fact that common thiophene-based oligomers adopting edge-to-face herringbone motifs exhibited p-type (hole-transporting) characters, the face-to-face stacked models based on annelated $\beta$-trithiophenes exhibited remarkably increased n-type (electron-transporting) performances. The electric field in the z-direction produced a small influence on the DD charge transport, whereas both electron and hole mobilities decreased dramatically in the MM case. More importantly, in MM charge transport, the electric field increases the hole mobility so that it is higher than that of the electron.},

For systems with both cationic and anionic sites, this leads to fractional electron transfer, even when standard basis sets are used, and thus a qualitative incorrect description of the electronic structure. Exchange functionals without Hartree-Fock exchange display the largest effects, but hybrid functionals also show the phenomenon, except for strongly bound anions. The source of the error is the incorrect long-range behavior of the exchange potential and can be avoided by employing the long-range correction method. The results have consequences for density functional descriptions of systems with localized anionic or strong electron donor sites for almost all of the commonly employed exchange-correlation functionals.},

abstract = {We propose an efficient Monte Carlo algorithm for simulating a ”hardly-relaxing” system, in which many replicas with different temperatures are simultaneously simulated and a virtual process exchanging configurations of these replicas is introduced. This exchange process is expected to let the system at low temperatures escape from a local minimum. By using this algorithm the three-dimensional +/-J Ising spin glass model is studied. The ergodicity time in this method is found much smaller than that of the multi-canonical method. In particular the time correlation function almost follows an exponential decay whose relaxation time is comparable to the ergodicity time at low temperatures. It suggests that the system relaxes very rapidly through the exchange process even in the low temperature phase.},

abstract = {The self-consistent charge density functional tight-binding (SCC-DFTB) method has been actively employed to study proton-transfer processes in biological systems. Recent studies in the literature employing SCC-DFTB reported that the method favors the Zundel form of the hydrated proton over the Eigen form, both in gas-phase water clusters and in bulk water, in disagreement with both higher-level calculations and experimental data. In this work, we explore the performance of SCC-DFTB for protonated gas-phase water clusters and bulk water (the latter both with and without an excess proton) with a modified O-H repulsive potential reported in our earlier work and with on-site third-order expansion of the DFT energy. Our results show that, with the proper set of published parameters, SCC-DFTB does correctly favor the Eigen form of the hydrated proton as compared to the Zundel form, both in gas-phase clusters and in the bulk; the amphiphilic character of the hydrated proton discussed in the literature has also been observed. The analyses do, however, bring forth remaining limitations in terms of the solvation structure around the hydrated proton as well as the structure of bulk water, which can guide future improvements of the method.},

@article{Lin2010,
abstract = {Computational and theoretical chemistry provide fundamental insights into the structures, properties, and reactivities of molecules. As a result, theoretical calculations have become indispensable in various fields of chemical research and development. In this Account, we present our research in the area of computational transition metal chemistry, using examples to illustrate how theory impacts our understanding of experimental results and how close collaboration between theoreticians and experimental chemists can be mutually beneficial. We begin by examining the use of computational chemistry to elucidate the details of some unusual chemical bonds. We consider the three-center, two-electron bonding in titanocene sigma-borane complexes and the five-center, four-electron bonding in a rhodium-bismuth complex. The bonding in metallabenzene complexes is also examined. In each case, theoretical calculations provide particular insight into the electronic structure of the chemical bonds. We then give an example of how theoretical calculations aided the structural determination of a kappa(2)-N,N chelate ruthenium complex formed upon heating an intermediate benzonitrile-coordinated complex. An initial X-ray diffraction structure proposed on the basis of a reasonable mechanism appeared to fit well, with an apparently acceptable R value of 0.0478. But when DFT calculations were applied, the optimized geometry differed significantly from the experimental data. By combining experimental and theoretical outlooks, we posited a new structure. Remarkably, a re-refining of the X-ray diffraction data based on the new structure resulted in a slightly lower R value of 0.0453. We further examine the use of computational chemistry in providing new insight into C-H bond activation mechanisms and in understanding the reactivity properties of nucleophilic boryl ligands, addressing experimental difficulties with calculations and vice versa. Finally, we consider the impact of theoretical insights in three very specific experimental studies of chemical reactions, illustrating how theoretical results prompt further experimental studies: (i) diboration of aldehydes catalyzed by copper(I) boryl complexes, (ii) ruthenium-catalyzed C-H amination of arylazides, and (iii) zinc reduction of a vinylcarbyne complex. The concepts and examples presented here are intended for nonspecialists, particularly experimentalists. Together, they illustrate some of the achievements that are possible with a fruitful union of experiment and theory.},

abstract = {In the field of organic electronics, a central issue is to assess how the frontier electronic levels of two adjacent organic layers align with respect to one another at the interface. This alignment can be driven by the presence of a partial charge transfer and the formation of an interface dipole; it plays a key role for instance in determining the rates of exciton dissociation or exciton formation in organic solar cells or light-emitting diodes, respectively. Reliably modeling the processes taking place at these interfaces remains a challenge for the computational chemistry community. Here, we review our recent theoretical work on the influence of the choice of density functional theory (DFT) methodology on the description of the charge-transfer character in the ground state of TTF/TCNQ model complexes and interfaces. Starting with the electronic properties of the isolated TTF and TCNQ molecules and then considering the charge transfer and resulting interface dipole in TTF/TCNQ donor-acceptor stacks and bilayers, we examine the impact of the choice of DFT functional in describing the interfacial electronic structure. Finally, we employ computations based on periodic boundary conditions to highlight the impact of depolarization effects on the interfacial dipole moment.},

abstract = {Channelrhodopsin-2 is a light-gated ion channel, which has been studied intensively over the last decade. Vibrational spectroscopic experiments started to shed light on the structural changes, that occur during the photocycle, especially in the hydrogen-bonded network surrounding the protonated D156 and C128 - the DC gate. However, the interpretation of these experiments was only based on homology models. Since then, an X-ray structure and better computational models became available. In this article, we show that in combination with a recent reparametrization, the approximate DFT method, DFTB, is able to describe the effects of hydrogen bonding on the C=O stretch vibration in carboxylic acids reliably and agrees well with full DFT results. We apply DFTB in a QM/MM framework to perform vibrational analysis of buried aspartic acids in bacteriorhodopsin and channelrhodopsin-2. Using this approach, we can simulate the FTIR spectral difference between D115 in the dark-adapted and K states of bacteriorhodopsin. The FTIR experiments on the DC gate in channelrhodopsin-2 are well described using an indirect model, where D156 and C128 are bridged via a water molecule.},

abstract = {A new self-consistent-charge density-functional tight-binding (SCC-DFTB) set of parameters for Ti−X pairs of elements (X = Ti, H, C, N, O, S) has been developed. The performance of this set has been tested with respect to TiO2 bulk phases and small molecular systems. It has been found that the band structures, geometric parameters, and cohesive energies of rutile and anatase polymorphs are in good agreement with the reference DFT data and with experiment. Low-index rutile and anatase surfaces were also tested. For molecular systems, binding and atomization energies close to their DFT analogues have been achieved. Large errors, however, have been found for systems in high-spin states and/or having multireference character of their wave functions. The correct performance of SCC-DFTB for surface reactions has been demonstrated via the water splitting on anatase (001) surface. The current SCC-DFTB set is a suitable tool for future in-depth investigation of chemical processes occurring on the surfaces of TiO2 polymorphs as well as for other processes of physicochemical interest.},

abstract = {We apply density fitting approximations to generate the 2-electron integrals in local MP2 (LMP2) to produce a method denoted DF-LMP2. The method can equally be seen as a local version of the well-known RI-MP2 method, which in this work is referred to as DF-MP2. Local approximations reduce the asymptotic scaling of computational resources to O(N), and the most expensive step of DF-MP2 [the O(N5] assembly) is rendered negligible in DF-LMP2. It is demonstrated that for large molecules DF-LMP2 is much faster (1–2 orders of magnitude) than either LMP2 or DF-MP2. The availablility of LMP2, DF-MP2 and DF-LMP2 has for the first time made it possible to assess the accuracy of local and density fitting approximations for extended molecules using cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ basis sets. The density fitting errors are found to be consistently small, but the errors arising from local approximations are somewhat larger than expected from calculations on smaller systems. It is proposed to apply local density fitting approximations also for the Fock matrix construction in Hartree-Fock calculations. Preliminary results demonstrate that this can lead to significant savings in the Hartree-Fock calculation. © 2003 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Helical symmetry is often encountered in nature and thus also in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In many cases, an approximation based on infinite helical periodicity can save a significant amount of computer time. However, standard simulations with the usual periodic boundary conditions (PBC) are not easily compatible with it. In the present study, we propose and investigate an algorithm comprising infinitely propagated helicity, which is compatible with commonly used MD software. The helical twist is introduced as a parametric geometry constraint, and the translational PBC are modified to allow for the helical symmetry via a transitional solvent volume. The algorithm including a parallel code was implemented within the Tinker software. The viability of the helical periodic boundary conditions (HPBC) was verified in test simulations including $\alpha$-helical and polyproline II like peptide structures. For an insulin-based model, the HPBC dynamics made it possible to simulate a fibrillar structure, otherwise not stable within PBC.},

abstract = {A method for relating pyranose ring conformation to experimental measurements is presented. A three-dimensional conformational space (Q, $\theta$, P2) based on a torsion angle formalism is projected in two dimensions ($\theta$, P2) and contours of calculable physical properties are plotted and compared to experimentally determined values. With this approach, conformations in a continuous conformational space that fit the physical data can be identified rapidly and the conformational space available to pyranose rings can be visualized easily. Iduronate, which is part of biologically important glycosaminoglycans such as dermatan sulfate, shows similar stability in several ring conformations. Thus, we find it is desired to extend the conformational analysis from canonical chair and skew-boat conformations to a continuous conformational space, when interpreting biophysical data related to the iduronate ring conformation. When the method is applied to the physical data available for dermatan sulfate, the results indicate that two families of $\alpha$-l-iduronate conformations each can explain both 2D-NMR and X-ray diffraction data for dermatan sulfate. Further, the mapping technique was used to investigate the interconversion between different conformations of the iduronate residue. The method described here offers a systematic search of conformations beyond the canonical chair, boat, and skew boat conformations and provides a graphical description of the deviations from these ideal conformers. The approach thus can be extended to ring conformational analysis of other pyranoses.},

abstract = {A popular strategy for simulating large systems where quantum chemical effects are important is the use of mixed quantum mechanical/molecular mechanics methods (QM/MM). While the cost of solving the Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation in the QM part is the bottleneck of these calculations, evaluating the Coulomb interaction between the QM and the MM part is surprisingly expensive. In fact it can be just as time-consuming as solving the QM part. We present here a novel real space multigrid approach that handles Coulomb interactions very effectively and implement it in the CP2K code. This novel scheme cuts the cost of this part of the calculation by 2 orders of magnitude. The method does not need very fine-tuning or adjustable parameters, and it is quite accurate, leading to a dynamics with very good energy conservation. We exemplify the validity of our algorithms with simulations of water and of a zwitterionic dipeptide solvated in water.},

abstract = {In this work, we augment the approximate density functional method SCC-DFTB (DFTB3) with the chemical-potential equalization (CPE) approach in order to improve the performance for molecular electronic polarizabilities. The CPE method, originally implemented for the NDDO type of methods by Giese and York, has been shown to significantly emend minimal basis methods with respect to the response properties and has been applied to SCC-DFTB recently. CPE allows this inherent limitation of minimal basis methods to be overcome by supplying an additional response density. The systematic underestimation is thereby corrected quantitatively without the need to extend the atomic orbital basis (i.e., without increasing the overall computational cost significantly). The dependency of polarizability as a function of the molecular charge state, especially, was significantly improved from the CPE extension of DFTB3. The empirical parameters introduced by the CPE approach were optimized for 172 organic molecules in order to match the results from density functional theory methods using large basis sets. However, the first-order derivatives of molecular polarizabilities (e.g., required to compute Raman activities) are not improved by the current CPE implementation (i.e., Raman spectra are not improved).},

abstract = {We have tested the performance of three frequently used density functionals(LDA, LDA+B, and LDA+B+LYP) in a study of the intermolecular interactions of benzene. Molecular geometries are satisfactory, with the gradient‐corrected density functionals yielding slightly better results. The quadrupole moment is significantly underestimated by all three functionals. LDA performs fortuitously comparatively well for both binding energies and geometries of the dimer and the solid, whereas in LDA+B, and LDA+B+LYP the dimer interaction is purely repulsive, leading to the complete absence of cohesion in the solid. These results are consistent with density‐functional theory calculations for noble gas dimers. However, when the dispersion energy calculated from a model potential is included, LDA fails. Binding energies are overestimated by unacceptable amounts, and intermolecular distances are too small. In contrast, dispersion corrected LDA+B and LDA+B+LYP perform reasonably well, although discrepancies are still large when measured on the thermal energy scale at room temperature.},

abstract = {Neutral and charged assemblies of $\pi$-conjugated molecules span the field of organic electronics. Electronic structure computations can provide valuable information regarding the nature of the intermolecular interactions within molecular precursors to organic electronics. Here, we introduce a database of neutral (Pi29n) and radical (Orel26rad) dimer complexes that represent binding energies between organic functional units. The new benchmarks are used to test approximate electronic structure methods. Achieving accurate interaction energies for neutral complexes (Pi29n) is straightforward, so long as dispersion interactions are properly taken into account. However, $\pi$-dimer radical cations (Orel26rad) are examples of highly challenging situations for density functional approximations. The role of dispersion corrections is crucial, yet simultaneously long-range corrected exchange schemes are necessary to provide the proper dimer dissociation behavior. Nevertheless, long-range corrected functionals seriously underestimate the binding energy of Orel26rad at equilibrium geometries. In fact, only ?B97X-D, an empirical exchange-correlation functional fitted together with an empirical ?classical? dispersion correction, leads to suitable results. Valuable alternatives are the more demanding MP2/6-31G*(0.25) level, as well as the most cost-effective combination involving a dispersion corrected long-range functional together with a smaller practical size basis set (e.g., LC-?PBEB95-dDsC/6-31G*). The Orel26rad test set should serve as an ideal benchmark for assessing the performance of improved schemes.},

abstract = {We report the parametrization of the approximate density functional tight binding method, DFTB3, for sulfur and phosphorus. The parametrization is done in a framework consistent with our previous 3OB set established for O, N, C, and H, thus the resulting parameters can be used to describe a broad set of organic and biologically relevant molecules. The 3d orbitals are included in the parametrization, and the electronic parameters are chosen to minimize errors in the atomization energies. The parameters are tested using a fairly diverse set of molecules of biological relevance, focusing on the geometries, reaction energies, proton affinities, and hydrogen bonding interactions of these molecules; vibrational frequencies are also examined, although less systematically. The results of DFTB3/3OB are compared to those from DFT (B3LYP and PBE), ab initio (MP2, G3B3), and several popular semiempirical methods (PM6 and PDDG), as well as predictions of DFTB3 with the older parametrization (the MIO set). In general, DFTB3/3OB is a major improvement over the previous parametrization (DFTB3/MIO), and for the majority cases tested here, it also outperforms PM6 and PDDG, especially for structural properties, vibrational frequencies, hydrogen bonding interactions, and proton affinities. For reaction energies, DFTB3/3OB exhibits major improvement over DFTB3/MIO, due mainly to significant reduction of errors in atomization energies; compared to PM6 and PDDG, DFTB3/3OB also generally performs better, although the magnitude of improvement is more modest. Compared to high-level calculations, DFTB3/3OB is most successful at predicting geometries; larger errors are found in the energies, although the results can be greatly improved by computing single point energies at a high level with DFTB3 geometries. There are several remaining issues with the DFTB3/3OB approach, most notably its difficulty in describing phosphate hydrolysis reactions involving a change in the coordination number of the phosphorus, for which a specific parametrization (3OB/OPhyd) is developed as a temporary solution; this suggests that the current DFTB3 methodology has limited transferability for complex phosphorus chemistry at the level of accuracy required for detailed mechanistic investigations. Therefore, fundamental improvements in the DFTB3 methodology are needed for a reliable method that describes phosphorus chemistry without ad hoc parameters. Nevertheless, DFTB3/3OB is expected to be a competitive QM method in QM/MM calculations for studying phosphorus/sulfur chemistry in condensed phase systems, especially as a low-level method that drives the sampling in a dual-level QM/MM framework.},

Functional organic molecular materials and conjugated oligomers or polymers now allow the low-cost fabrication of thin films for insertion into new generations of electronic and optoelectronic devices. The performance of these devices relies on the understanding and optimization of several complementary processes (see sketch). Our goal is to discuss, from a theoretical standpoint, the electronic structure characteristics and interfacial properties that are of importance in all these areas. The concept of interface should be taken here in the microscopic sense, i.e., molecular interactions among two or several chains/molecules (of the same or of a different nature). Specifically, we will address the impact of interchain interactions within an organic layer on the transport and optical properties. These issues will therefore be more directly related to transistor and light-emitting diode applications; however, in all instances, the aspects related to interfacial charge or energy transfer processes will dictate the ultimate performance of a material in a given device.},

abstract = {Open-shell singlet diradicals are difficult to model accurately within conventional Kohn-Sham (KS) density-functional theory (DFT). These methods are hampered by spin contamination because the KS determinant wave function is neither a pure spin state nor an eigenfunction of the S(2) operator. Here we present a theoretical foray for using single-reference closed-shell ground states to describe diradicals by fractional-spin DFT (FS-DFT). This approach allows direct, self-consistent calculation of electronic properties using the electron density corresponding to the proper spin eigenfunction. The resulting FS-DFT approach is benchmarked against diradical singlet-triplet gaps for atoms and small molecules. We have also applied FS-DFT to the singlet-triplet gaps of hydrocarbon polyacenes.},

Potentials are presented for the third-, fourth-, and fifth-row atoms of the Periodic Table (excluding the lanthanide series).

The resulting overhead, for medium and large systems, is a small fraction of the total computational cost, representing a dramatic speedup over the O(N(2)) evaluation of the double integral.

Literally millions of nonbonded contact distances have been characterized by crystallography since the tabulations were compiled. A study has therefore been performed to establish the degree of consistency between these accumulated crystallographic data and the van der Waals radii of the common nonmetallic elements, as compiled by Pauling and Bondi. For halogens and sulfur, the results show a remarkable agreement between observed contact distances and the Bondi radii. Agreement is slightly less good for carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, but discrepancies are still only about 0.05 {\AA}. However, there is a significant difference for hydrogen, where the Bondi v...},

This extends previous work of ours where the density was expanded only in plane waves. We describe the total density in a smooth extended part which we represent in plane waves as in our previous work and parts localised close to the nuclei which are expanded in Gaussians. Using this representation of the charge we show how the localised and extended part can be treated separately, achieving a computational cost for the calculation of the Kohn-Sham matrix that scales with the system size N as O(N log N). Furthermore, we are able to reduce drastically the size of the plant-wave basis. In addition. we introduce a multiple-cutoff method that improves considerably the performance of this approach. Finally, we demonstrate with a series of numerical examples the accuracy and efficiency of the new algorithm, both for electronic structure calculations and for ab initio molecular dynamics simulations.},

abstract = {Density functional approximations fail to provide a consistent description of weak molecular interactions arising from small electron density overlaps. A simple remedy to correct for the missing interactions is to add a posteriori an attractive energy term summed over all atom pairs in the system. The density-dependent energy correction, presented herein, is applicable to all elements of the periodic table and is easily combined with any electronic structure method, which lacks the accurate treatment of weak interactions. Dispersion coefficients are computed according to Becke and Johnson?s exchange-hole dipole moment (XDM) formalism, thereby depending on the chemical environment of an atom (density, oxidation state). The long-range ?R?6 potential is supplemented with higher-order correction terms (?R?8 and ?R?10) through the universal damping function of Tang and Toennies. A genuine damping factor depending on (iterative) Hirshfeld (overlap) populations, atomic ionization energies, and two adjustable parameters specifically fitted to a given DFT functional is also introduced. The proposed correction, dDXDM, dramatically improves the performance of popular density functionals. The analysis of 30 (dispersion corrected) density functionals on 145 systems reveals that dDXDM largely reduces the errors of the parent functionals for both inter- and intramolecular interactions. With mean absolute deviations (MADs) of 0.74?0.84 kcal mol?1, PBE-dDXDM, PBE0-dDXDM, and B3LYP-dDXDM outperform the computationally more demanding and most recent functionals such as M06-2X and B2PLYP-D (MAD of 1.93 and 1.06 kcal mol?1, respectively).},

abstract = {A simple method for computing accurate density-dependent dispersion coefficients is presented. The dispersion coefficients are modeled by a generalized gradient-type approximation to Becke and Johnson's exchange hole dipole moment formalism. Our most cost-effective variant, based on a disjoint description of atoms in a molecule, gives mean absolute errors in the C(6) coefficients for 90 complexes below 10{\%}. The inclusion of the missing long-range van der Waals interactions in density functionals using the derived coefficients in a pair wise correction leads to highly accurate typical noncovalent interaction energies.},

@article{Warshel1976,
abstract = {A general method for detailed study of enzymic reactions is presented. The method considers the complete enzyme-substrate complex together with the surrounding solvent and evaluates all the different quantum mechanical and classical energy factors that can affect the reaction pathway. These factors include the quantum mechanical energies associated with bond cleavage and charge redistribution of the substrate and the classical energies of steric and electrostatic interactions between the substrate and the enzyme. The electrostatic polarization of the enzyme atoms and the orientation of the dipoles of the surrounding water molecules is simulated by a microscopic dielectric model. The solvation energy resulting from this polarization is considerable and must be included in any realistic calculation of chemical reactions involving anything more than an isolated molecule in vacuo. Without it, acidic groups can never become ionized and the charge distribution on the substrate will not be reasonable. The same dielectric model can also be used to study the reaction of the substrate in solution. In this way the reaction in solution can be compared with the enzymic reaction. In this paper we study the stability of the carbonium ion intermediate formed in the cleavage of a glycosidic bond by lysozyme. It is found that electrostatic stabilization is an important factor in increasing the rate of the reaction step that leads to the formation of the carbonium ion intermediate. Steric factors, such as the strain of the substrate on binding to lysozyme, do not seem to contribute significantly.},

abstract = {Accurate modeling of noncovalent interactions involving sulfur today is ubiquitous, particularly with regard to the role played by sulfur-containing heterocycles in the field of organic electronics. The density functional tight binding (DFTB) method offers a good compromise between computational efficiency and accuracy, enabling the treatment of thousands of atoms at a fraction of the cost of density functional theory (DFT) evaluations. DFTB is an approximate quantum chemical approach that is based on the DFT total energy expression. Here, we address a critical issue inherent to the DFTB parametrization, which prevents the use of the DFTB framework for simulating noncovalent interactions involving sulfur atoms and precludes its combination with a dispersion correction. (1-5) Dramatic examples of structural patterns relevant to the field of organic electronics illustrate that DFTB delivers erroneous (i.e., qualitatively wrong) results involving spurious binding.},

abstract = {Absolute free energies of hydration (DeltaGhyd) have been computed for 25 diverse organic molecules using partial atomic charges derived from AM1 and PM3 wave functions via the CM1 and CM3 procedures of Cramer, Truhlar, and coworkers. Comparisons are made with results using charges fit to the electrostatic potential surface (EPS) from ab initio 6-31G* wave functions and from the OPLS-AA force field. OPLS Lennard-Jones parameters for the organic molecules were used together with the TIP4P water model in Monte Carlo simulations with free energy perturbation theory. Absolute free energies of hydration were computed for OPLS united-atom and all-atom methane by annihilating the solutes in water and in the gas phase, and absolute DeltaGhyd values for all other molecules were computed via transformation to one of these references. Optimal charge scaling factors were determined by minimizing the unsigned average error between experimental and calculated hydration free energies. The PM3-based charge models do not lead to lower average errors than obtained with the EPS charges for the subset of 13 molecules in the original study. However, improvement is obtained by scaling the CM1A partial charges by 1.14 and the CM3A charges by 1.15, which leads to average errors of 1.0 and 1.1 kcal/mol for the full set of 25 molecules. The scaled CM1A charges also yield the best results for the hydration of amides including the E/Z free-energy difference for N-methylacetamide in water.},

The conformational behavior of the two constituting disaccharide segments was investigated using a systematic grid search approach with the MM3 force field along with the proper parameters for the sulfate ester group. The exploration of the potential energy surfaces of the trisaccharide was performed through the use of the CICADA methods interfaced with the MM3 force field. In all cases, the 2-O-sulfo-[alpha]--iduronate moiety was given the three favored ring conformations 1C4, 4C1, and 2S0. Conformations were clustered into families, four of which are likely to exhibit significant occupancy in solution. The different low-energy conformational families display different orientations at the glycosidic linkages and/or different ring shapes for the iduronate ring. The 2S0 conformation is the major one for the 2-O-sulfo-[alpha]--iduronate but is still in equilibrium with the 1C4 ring shape. The occurrence of such a conformational equilibrium in solution was probed via high-resolution NMR spectroscopy through measurements of coupling constants and NOE build-up. These results are in keeping with the observation that 2-O-sulfated pentasaccharides display a similar affinity for antithrombin III as their 2-N-sulfated counterparts.</p>},

abstract = {An efficient parallel implementation of QM/MM-based replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) as well as umbrella samplings techniques was proposed by adopting the generalized distributed data interface (GDDI). Parallelization speed-up of 40.5 on 48 cores was achieved, making our QM/MM-MD engine a robust tool for studying complex chemical dynamics in solution. They were comparatively used to study the torsional isomerization of hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution. All results by QM/MM-REMD and QM/MM umbrella sampling techniques yielded nearly identical potentials of mean force (PMFs) regardless of the particular QM theories for solute, showing that the overall dynamics are mainly determined by solvation. Although the entropic penalty of solvent rearrangements exists in cisoid conformers, it was found that both strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions preferentially stabilize them in solution, reducing the torsional free-energy barrier at 0° by about 3 kcal/mol as compared to that in gas phase.},

abstract = {The semiconductor industry has seen a remarkable miniaturization trend, driven by many scientific and technological innovations. But if this trend is to continue, and provide ever faster and cheaper computers, the size of microelectronic circuit components will soon need to reach the scale of atoms or molecules--a goal that will require conceptually new device structures. The idea that a few molecules, or even a single molecule, could be embedded between electrodes and perform the basic functions of digital electronics--rectification, amplification and storage--was first put forward in the mid-1970s. The concept is now realized for individual components, but the economic fabrication of complete circuits at the molecular level remains challenging because of the difficulty of connecting molecules to one another. A possible solution to this problem is 'mono-molecular' electronics, in which a single molecule will integrate the elementary functions and interconnections required for computation.},

abstract = {A new method to calculate the atom-atom dispersion coefficients in a molecule is proposed for the use in density functional theory with dispersion (DFT-D) correction. The method is based on the local response approximation due to Dobson and Dinte [Phys. Rev. Lett. 76, 1780 (1996)], with modified dielectric model recently proposed by Vydrov and van Voorhis [J. Chem. Phys. 130, 104105 (2009)]. The local response model is used to calculate the distributed multipole polarizabilities of atoms in a molecule, from which the dispersion coefficients are obtained by an explicit frequency integral of the Casimir-Polder type. Thus obtained atomic polarizabilities are also used in the damping function for the short-range singularity. Unlike empirical DFT-D methods, the local response dispersion (LRD) method is able to calculate the dispersion energy from the ground-state electron density only. It is applicable to any geometry, free from physical constants such as van der Waals radii or atomic polarizabilities, and computationally very efficient. The LRD method combined with the long-range corrected DFT functional (LC-BOP) is applied to calculations of S22 weakly bound complex set [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 8, 1985 (2006)]. Binding energies obtained by the LC-BOP+LRD agree remarkably well with ab initio references.},

abstract = {During the past decade, computer simulations based on a quantum-mechanical description of the interactions between electrons and between electrons and atomic nuclei have developed an increasingly important impact on solid-state physics and chemistry and on materials science-promoting not only a deeper understanding, but also the possibility to contribute significantly to materials design for future technologies. This development is based on two important columns: (i) The improved description of electronic many-body effects within density-functional theory (DFT) and the upcoming post-DFT methods. (ii) The implementation of the new functionals and many-body techniques within highly efficient, stable, and versatile computer codes, which allow to exploit the potential of modern computer architectures. In this review, I discuss the implementation of various DFT functionals [local-density approximation (LDA), generalized gradient approximation (GGA), meta-GGA, hybrid functional mixing DFT, and exact (Hartree-Fock) exchange] and post-DFT approaches [DFT + U for strong electronic correlations in narrow bands, many-body perturbation theory (GW) for quasiparticle spectra, dynamical correlation effects via the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem (AC-FDT)] in the Vienna ab initio simulation package VASP. VASP is a plane-wave all-electron code using the projector-augmented wave method to describe the electron-core interaction. The code uses fast iterative techniques for the diagonalization of the DFT Hamiltonian and allows to perform total-energy calculations and structural optimizations for systems with thousands of atoms and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations for ensembles with a few hundred atoms extending over several tens of ps. Applications in many different areas (structure and phase stability, mechanical and dynamical properties, liquids, glasses and quasicrystals, magnetism and magnetic nanostructures, semiconductors and insulators, surfaces, interfaces and thin films, chemical reactions, and catalysis) are reviewed.},

abstract = {We discuss donor-acceptor conjugated polymers where the acceptor moieties are orthogonal to the donor-based backbone direction through the synthesis and study of a new class of materials (including six oligomers and three polymers) based on 4H-cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) with an imine functionality introduced at the CPDT bridgehead position. Absorption spectroscopy provides information on the influence of structure on the optical properties. We paid special attention to the energies and oscillator strengths of the low-energy transitions and how they correlate with chain length. When the orthogonally conjugated materials are compared to a more traditional polymer, where the donor and acceptor fragments are in series along the backbone direction, fundamental differences in the optical properties are observed. Quantum-mechanical studies of the geometric structure, electronic structure, and excited-state vertical transitions using density functional theory unravel the interplay of structural design and resulting optoelectronic properties. Our findings underline that the magnitude and orientation relative to the backbone long axis of the transition dipole moment is key in designing narrow optical-gap materials with large absorption cross-sections and oscillator strengths.},

abstract = {In this paper, we review the foundations of the density-functional tight-binding (DFTB) method. The method is based on the density-functional theory as formulated by Hohenberg and Kohn. It introduces several approximations: First, densities and potentials are written as superpositions of atomic densities and potentials. Second, many-center terms are summarized together with nuclear repulsion energy terms in a way that they can be written as a sum of pairwise repulsive terms. For small distances, the nuclear repulsion dominates, whereas for large distances, these terms vanish. The Kohn–Sham orbitals are expanded in a set of localized atom-centered functions. They are represented in a minimal basis of optimized atomic orbitals, which are obtained for spherical symmetric spin-unpolarized neutral atoms self-consistently. The whole Hamilton and overlap matrices contain one- and two-center contributions only. Therefore, they can be calculated and tabulated in advance as functions of the distance between atomic pairs. In addition, we discuss a self-consistent charge extension, the treatment of weak interactions, and a linear response scheme in connection with the DFTB method. Finally, some practical aspects are presented. © 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

In these systems, the molecule?metal contact is detrimental to electron transport. This is manifested not only in contact resistance, but also in the nature of the molecular device, which depends on the extent of wave function mixing between the molecule and the metal surface. We probe interfacial electronic structure, particularly unoccupied electronic states, in thiolate SAMs on Cu(111) using laser two-photon photoemission spectroscopy, in conjunction with ab initio calculations of model molecules. We find that the interfacial electronic structure is dominated by two virtual orbitals localized to the thiolate anchor and strongly coupled to the metal substrate. The shapes and energies of these interfacial $\sigma$*-like orbitals are independent of the nature of the hydrocarbon group (conjugated aromatics or saturated alkyls). As low-lying acceptor orbitals, they may play important roles in electron transport through self-assembled molecular wires.},

abstract = {The use of organic polymers for electronic functions is mainly motivated by the low-end applications, where low cost rather than advanced performance is a driving force. Materials and processing methods must allow for cheap production. Printing of electronics using inkjets or classical printing methods has considerable potential to deliver this. Another technology that has been around for millennia is weaving using fibres. Integration of electronic functions within fabrics, with production methods fully compatible with textiles, is therefore of current interest, to enhance performance and extend functions of textiles. Standard polymer field-effect transistors require well defined insulator thickness and high voltage, so they have limited suitability for electronic textiles. Here we report a novel approach through the construction of wire electrochemical transistor (WECT) devices, and show that textile monofilaments with 10-100 mum diameters can be coated with continuous thin films of the conducting polythiophene poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), and used to create micro-scale WECTs on single fibres. We also demonstrate inverters and multiplexers for digital logic. This opens an avenue for three-dimensional polymer micro-electronics, where large-scale circuits can be designed and integrated directly into the three-dimensional structure of woven fibres.},

abstract = {Heparin was isolated in the beginning of the 20th century and until today remains as one of the most important drugs able to interfere with the haemostatic process. Due to the side effects produced by heparin therapy, new promising drugs have been developed, as the synthetic pentasaccharide (synthetically derived from the sequence GlcN-GlcA-GlcN-IdoA-GlcN). The anticoagulant activity of this compound is based on potentiation of antithrombin (AT) inhibitory activity upon serine proteinases of clotting cascade, a mechanism based on the conformational modification of AT. In this context, we present here a molecular dynamics (MD) study of the interaction between the synthetic pentasaccharide and AT. The obtained data correctly predicted an induced fit mechanism in AT-pentasaccharide interaction, showing a solvent-exposed P1 residue instead of a hided conformation. Also, the specific contribution of important amino acid residues to the overall process was also characterized, both in 2S0 and 1C4 conformations of IdoA residue, suggesting that there is no conformational requirement to the interaction of this residue with AT. Altogether, the results show that MD simulations could be used to characterize and quantify the interaction of synthetic compounds with AT, predicting its specific capacity to induce conformational changes in AT structure. Thus, MD simulations of heparin (and heparin-derived)-AT interactions are proposed here as a powerful tool to assist and support drug design of new antithrombotic agents.},

abstract = {The effect of using different methods to obtain atoms in molecules (AIMs) on the shared-electron distribution indices (SEDIs) and domain-averaged Fermi holes (DAFHs) is examined using a test set of diatomic molecules. Use of Bader's binary AIM model gives significantly different SEDIs as a function of internuclear distances than do self-consistent Hirshfeld-based AIM models. DAFH eigenvectors remain very similar for all AIM among the different methods. The corresponding eigenvalues are found to differ significantly, although the sums of complementary eigenvalues show only relatively small changes. The choice of a binary division of molecular space into AIM domains is found to lead to extra structure in SEDI curves, but this probably has limited chemical significance.},

abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is a method of simplifying complex datasets to generate a lower number of parameters, while retaining the essential differences and allowing objective comparison of large numbers of datasets. Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are a class of linear sulfated carbohydrates with diverse sequences and consequent complex conformation and structure. Here, PCA is applied to three problems in GAG research: (i) distinguishing origins of heparin preparations, (ii) structural analysis of heparin derivatives, and (iii) classification of chondroitin sulfates (CS). The results revealed the following. (i) PCA of heparin 13C NMR spectra allowed their origins to be distinguished and structural differences were identified. (ii) Analysis of the information-rich 1H and 13C NMR spectra of a series of systematically modified heparin derivatives uncovered underlying properties. These included the presence of interactions between residues, providing evidence that a degree of degeneracy exists in linkage geometry and that a different degree of variability exists for the two types of glycosidic linkage. The relative sensitivity of each position (C or H nucleus) in the disaccharide repeating unit to changes in O-, N-sulfation and N-acetylation was also revealed. (iii) Analysis of the 1H NMR and CD spectra of a series of CS samples from different origins allowed their structural classification and highlighted the power of employing complementary spectroscopic methods in concert with PCA.},

abstract = {A thorough energy benchmark study of various density functionals (DFs) is carried out with the new GMTKN30 database for general main group thermochemistry, kinetics and noncovalent interactions [Goerigk and Grimme, J. Chem. Theor. Comput., 2010, 6, 107; Goerigk and Grimme, J. Chem. Theor. Comput., 2011, 7, 291]. In total, 47 DFs are investigated: two LDAs, 14 GGAs, three meta-GGAs, 23 hybrids and five double-hybrids. Besides the double-hybrids, also other modern approaches, i.e., the M05 and M06 classes of functionals and range-separated hybrids, are tested. For almost all functionals, the new DFT-D3 correction is applied in order to consistently test the performance also for important noncovalent interactions; the parameters are taken from previous works or determined for the present study. Basis set and quadrature grid issues are also considered. The general aim of the study is to work out which functionals are generally well applicable and robust to describe the energies of molecules. In summary, we recommend on the GGA level the B97-D3 and revPBE-D3 functionals. The best meta-GGA is oTPSS-D3 although meta-GGAs represent in general no clear improvement compared to numerically simpler GGAs. Notably, the widely used B3LYP functional performs worse than the average of all tested hybrids and is also very sensitive to the application of dispersion corrections. We discourage its usage as a standard method without closer inspection of the results, as it still seems to be often done nowadays. Surprisingly, long-range corrected exchange functionals do in general not perform better than the corresponding standard hybrids. However, the $\omega$B97X-D functional seems to be a promising method. The most robust hybrid is Zhao and Truhlar's PW6B95 functional in combination with DFT-D3. If higher accuracy is required, double-hybrids should be applied. The corresponding DSD-BLYP-D3 and PWPB95-D3 variants are the most accurate and robust functionals of the entire study. Additional calculations with MP2 and and its spin-scaled variants SCS-MP2, S2-MP2 and SOS-MP2 revealed that double-hybrids in general outperform those. Only SCS-MP2 can be recommended, particularly for reaction energies. We suggest its usage when a large self-interaction error is expected that prohibits usage of double-hybrids. Perdews' metaphoric picture of Jacob's Ladder for the classification of density functionals' performance could unbiasedly be confirmed with GMTKN30. We also show that there is no statistical correlation between a functional's accuracy for atomization energies and the performance for chemically more relevant reaction energies.},

abstract = {Standard density functional theory (DFT) is augmented with a damped empirical dispersion term. The damping function is optimized on a small, well balanced set of 22 van der Waals (vdW) complexes and verified on a validation set of 58 vdW complexes. Both sets contain biologically relevant molecules such as nucleic acid bases. Results are in remarkable agreement with reference high-level wave function data based on the CCSD(T) method. The geometries obtained by full gradient optimization are in very good agreement with the best available theoretical reference. In terms of the standard deviation and average errors, results including the empirical dispersion term are clearly superior to all pure density functionals investigated-B-LYP, B3-LYP, PBE, TPSS, TPSSh, and BH-LYP-and even surpass the MP2/cc-pVTZ method. The combination of empirical dispersion with the TPSS functional performs remarkably well. The most critical part of the empirical dispersion approach is the damping function. The damping parameters should be optimized for each density functional/basis set combination separately. To keep the method simple, we optimized mainly a single factor, s(R), scaling globally the vdW radii. For good results, a basis set of at least triple-zeta quality is required and diffuse functions are recommended, since the basis set superposition error seriously deteriorates the results. On average, the dispersion contribution to the interaction energy missing in the DFT functionals examined here is about 15 and 100{\%} for the hydrogen-bonded and stacked complexes considered, respectively.},

abstract = {We introduce a hybrid density functional that asymptotically incorporates full Hartree-Fock exchange, based on the long-range-corrected exchange-hole model of Henderson et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 128, 194105 (2008)]. The performance of this functional, for ground-state properties and for vertical excitation energies within time-dependent density functional theory, is systematically evaluated, and optimal values are determined for the range-separation parameter, omega, and for the fraction of short-range Hartree-Fock exchange. We denote the new functional as LRC-omegaPBEh, since it reduces to the standard PBEh hybrid functional (also known as PBE0 or PBE1PBE) for a certain choice of its two parameters. Upon optimization of these parameters against a set of ground- and excited-state benchmarks, the LRC-omegaPBEh functional fulfills three important requirements: (i) It outperforms the PBEh hybrid functional for ground-state atomization energies and reaction barrier heights; (ii) it yields statistical errors comparable to PBEh for valence excitation energies in both small and medium-sized molecules; and (iii) its performance for charge-transfer excitations is comparable to its performance for valence excitations. LRC-omegaPBEh, with the parameters determined herein, is the first density functional that satisfies all three criteria. Notably, short-range Hartree-Fock exchange appears to be necessary in order to obtain accurate ground-state properties and vertical excitation energies using the same value of omega.},

Results are presented for the S22 set of non-covalent interaction energies, the G3/99 set of heat of formations and conformational energies of a phenylalanyl-glycyl-glycine peptide model. We furthermore propose seven hydrocarbon reactions with strong intramolecular dispersion contributions as a benchmark set for newly developed density functionals. In general, the proposed composite approach is for many chemically relevant properties of similar quality as high-level coupled-cluster treatments. A significant increase of the accuracy for non-covalent interactions is obtained and the corrected B2PLYP DHDF provides one of the lowest ever obtained Mean Absolute Deviations (MAD) for the S22 set (0.2-0.3 kcal mol(-1)). Unprecedented high accuracy is also obtained for the relative energies of peptide conformations that turn out to be very difficult. The significant improvements found for the G3/99 set (reduction of the MAD from 2.4 to 1.7 kcal mol(-1)) underline the importance of intramolecular dispersion effects in large molecules. In all tested cases the results from the standard B3LYP approach are also significantly improved, and we recommend the general use of dispersion corrections in DFT treatments.},

abstract = {Since its formal inception in 1964-1965, Kohn-Sham density-functional theory (KS-DFT) has become the most popular electronic structure method in computational physics and chemistry. Its popularity stems from its beautifully simple conceptual framework and computational elegance. The rise of KS-DFT in chemical physics began in earnest in the mid 1980s, when crucial developments in its exchange-correlation term gave the theory predictive power competitive with well-developed wave-function methods. Today KS-DFT finds itself under increasing pressure to deliver higher and higher accuracy and to adapt to ever more challenging problems. If we are not mindful, however, these pressures may submerge the theory in the wave-function sea. KS-DFT might be lost. I am hopeful the Kohn-Sham philosophical, theoretical, and computational framework can be preserved. This Perspective outlines the history, basic concepts, and present status of KS-DFT in chemical physics, and offers suggestions for its future development.},

abstract = {The standard self-consistent-charge density-functional-tight-binding (SCC-DFTB) method (Phys. Rev. B 1998, 58, 7260) is derived by a second-order expansion of the density functional theory total energy expression, followed by an approximation of the charge density fluctuations by charge monopoles and an effective damped Coulomb interaction between the atomic net charges. The central assumptions behind this effective charge-charge interaction are the inverse relation of atomic size and chemical hardness and the use of a fixed chemical hardness parameter independent of the atomic charge state. While these approximations seem to be unproblematic for many covalently bound systems, they are quantitatively insufficient for hydrogen-bonding interactions and (anionic) molecules with localized net charges. Here, we present an extension of the SCC-DFTB method to incorporate third-order terms in the charge density fluctuations, leading to chemical hardness parameters that are dependent on the atomic charge state and a modification of the Coulomb scaling to improve the electrostatic treatment within the second-order terms. These modifications lead to a significant improvement in the description of hydrogen-bonding interactions and proton affinities of biologically relevant molecules.},

A weak VdW bond is formed between closed-shell atoms or molecules as soon as the small Pauli repulsion is offset in long range by attractive VdW interactions. These are distortion and dispersion interactions, related to the electric properties of the interacting molecules, and described as small second-order effects in terms of long range interaction integrals $\beta$s. The explicit forms of these $\beta$s are derived from classical electrostatics for atom–atom, atom–linear molecule dispersion, and atom–linear molecule induction. Comparison between C6 dispersion and induction coefficients for simple homodimers shows that dispersion is, in general, the most important attractive VdW interaction in long range.},

@article{Lundberg2012,
abstract = {It has previously been shown that self-consistent-charge density-functional tight-binding (SCC-DFTB) suffers from a self-interaction error that leads to artificial stabilization of delocalized states. The effects of the error are similar to those appearing for many density functionals. In SCC-DFTB, the delocalization error is inherently related to the use of a Hubbard-like term to describe on-site charge interactions. The mathematical simplicity of this Hubbard-like term makes it easy to estimate if a complex system is subject to artificial stabilization of delocalized states and to quantitatively predict the delocalization error in the system energy at large fragment separation. The error is directly proportional to the on-site charge interaction term but decreases as the fragments become more asymmetric. The difference in orbital energies required to eliminate the delocalization error becomes equal to the Hubbard-like parameter of the fragment with the highest electron affinity. However, in most cases, the localized state will be favored by spin polarization, fragment repulsion, solvent effects, and large reorganization energies, in analogy to density functional theory, from which SCC-DFTB is derived. The presented analysis gives an early indication whether the standard approach is suitable, or if a different method is required to correct the delocalization error. In addition to cationic dimers, we discuss the effects of the delocalization error for asymmetric systems, bond dissociation of neutral molecules, and the description of mixed valence transition metal systems, exemplified by the enzyme cytochrome oxidase. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

@article{Elstner2000,
abstract = {A common feature of traditional tight-binding (TB) methods is the non-self-consistent solution of the eigenvalue problem of a Hamiltonian operator, represented in a minimal basis set. These TB schemes have been applied mostly to solid state systems, containing atoms with similar electronegativities. Recently self-consistent TB schemes have been developed which now allow the treatment of systems where a redistribution of charges, and the related detailed charge balance between the atoms, become important as e.g. in biological systems. We discuss the application of such a method, a self-consistent charge density-functional based TB scheme (SCC-DFTB), to biological model compounds. We present recent extensions of the method: (i) The combination of the tight binding scheme with an empirical force field, that makes large scale simulations with several thousand atoms possible. (ii) An extension which allows a quantitative description of weak-bonding interactions in biological systems. The latter include an improved description of hydrogen bonding achieved by extending the basis set and improved molecular stacking interactions achieved by incorporating the dispersion contributions empirically. In applying the method, we present benchmarks for conformational energies, geometries and frequencies of small peptides and compare with ab initio and semiempirical quantum chemistry data. These developments provide a fast and reliable method, which can handle large scale quantum molecular dynamic simulations in biological systems.},

abstract = {The method of dispersion correction as an add-on to standard Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT-D) has been refined regarding higher accuracy, broader range of applicability, and less empiricism. The main new ingredients are atom-pairwise specific dispersion coefficients and cutoff radii that are both computed from first principles. The coefficients for new eighth-order dispersion terms are computed using established recursion relations. System (geometry) dependent information is used for the first time in a DFT-D type approach by employing the new concept of fractional coordination numbers (CN). They are used to interpolate between dispersion coefficients of atoms in different chemical environments. The method only requires adjustment of two global parameters for each density functional, is asymptotically exact for a gas of weakly interacting neutral atoms, and easily allows the computation of atomic forces. Three-body nonadditivity terms are considered. The method has been assessed on standard benchmark sets for inter- and intramolecular noncovalent interactions with a particular emphasis on a consistent description of light and heavy element systems. The mean absolute deviations for the S22 benchmark set of noncovalent interactions for 11 standard density functionals decrease by 15{\%}-40{\%} compared to the previous (already accurate) DFT-D version. Spectacular improvements are found for a tripeptide-folding model and all tested metallic systems. The rectification of the long-range behavior and the use of more accurate C(6) coefficients also lead to a much better description of large (infinite) systems as shown for graphene sheets and the adsorption of benzene on an Ag(111) surface. For graphene it is found that the inclusion of three-body terms substantially (by about 10{\%}) weakens the interlayer binding. We propose the revised DFT-D method as a general tool for the computation of the dispersion energy in molecules and solids of any kind with DFT and related (low-cost) electronic structure methods for large systems.},

Subsequent carbonization by ultraviolet irradiation in ambient conditions resulted in the quantitative carbonization of the hexayne sublayer. Carbon nanosheets prepared in this way retained their surface functionalization and featured an sp(2)-rich amorphous carbon structure comparable to that usually obtained on annealing above 800 °C.

The sum of Gaussians is exploited for reconstructing iteratively an estimator of the free energy and forcing the system to escape from local minima. This review is intended to provide a comprehensive description of the algorithm, with a focus on the practical aspects that need to be addressed when one attempts to apply metadynamics to a new system: (i) the choice of the appropriate set of collective variables; (ii) the optimal choice of the metadynamics parameters and (iii) how to control the error and ensure convergence of the algorithm.},

About half of all sulphur atoms from cyst(e)ine and methionine residues are in contact ( ??? 6 ?? from ring centroid) with an aromatic ring (phenylalanine, tyrosine or tryptophan). Compared to carbon and nitrogen atoms the interacting sulphur atoms express an affinity towards the edge of the aromatic rings, and avoid the region above the ring in the vicinity of the ??-electrons. This preference is similar to that previously found for oxygen atoms around phenylalanine rings, and may be electrostatic in origin.

abstract = {A damped London dispersion interaction is generally adopted in empirical dispersion corrections on density functional theory (DFT), where dispersion parameters are determined empirically to reproduce correct dispersive interactions after assuming a damping function. The key to a successful dispersion correction is choosing an appropriate damping function. In this work we propose a single universal damping function that can represent several damping functions used in literatures with a few adjustable parameters. This universal damping function provides a unified formula that allows convenient comparison and flexible optimization in dispersion corrected DFT methods. Using the optimized universal damping functions and dispersion parameters, we develop dispersion correction methods for HF, B3LYP and PBE theories. We calculate the dispersive energies accurately for rare gas diatomic molecules and benzene dimers with an averaged error <4.1{\%}. {\{}[{\}}doi: 10.2320/matertrans.MF200911]},

abstract = {A quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) approach based on an approximate density functional theory, the so-called self-consistent charge density functional tight binding (SCC-DFTB) method, has been implemented in the CHARMM program and tested on a number of systems of biological interest. In the gas phase, SCC-DFTB gives reliable energetics for models of the triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) catalyzed reactions. The rms errors in the energetics compared to B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) are about 2?4 kcal/mol; this is to be contrasted with AM1, where the corresponding errors are 9?11 kcal/mol. The method also gives accurate vibrational frequencies. For the TIM reactions in the presence of the enzyme, the overall SCC-DFTB/CHARMM results are in somewhat worse agreement with the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p)/CHARMM values; the rms error in the energies is 5.4 kcal/mol. Single-point B3LYP/CHARMM energies at the SCC-DFTB/CHARMM optimized structures were found to be very similar to the full B3LYP/CHARMM values. The relative stabilities of the $\alpha$R and 310 conformations of penta- and octaalanine peptides were studied with minimization and molecular dynamics simulations in vacuum and in solution. Although CHARMM and SCC-DFTB give qualitative different results in the gas phase (the latter is in approximate agreement with previous B3LYP calculations), similar behavior was found in aqueous solution simulations with CHARMM and SCC-DFTB/CHARMM. The 310 conformation was not found to be stable, and converted to the $\alpha$R form in about 15 ps. The $\alpha$R conformation was stable in the simulation with both SCC-DFTB/CHARMM and CHARMM. The i,i+3 CO···HN distances in the $\alpha$R conformation were shorter with the SCC-DFTB method (2.58 {\AA}) than with CHARMM (3.13 {\AA}). With SCC-DFTB/CHARMM, significant populations with i,i+3 CO···HN distances near 2.25 {\AA}, particularly for the residues at the termini, were found.

abstract = {Among all functional groups, alkynes occupy a privileged position in synthetic and medicinal chemistry, chemical biology, and materials science. Thioalkynes, in particular, are highly useful, as they combine the enhanced reactivity of the triple bond with a sulfur atom frequently encountered in bioactive compounds and materials. Nevertheless, general methods to access these compounds are lacking. In this article, we describe the mechanism and full scope of the alkynylation of thiols using ethynyl benziodoxolone (EBX) hypervalent iodine reagents. Computations led to the discovery of a new, three-atom concerted transition state with a very low energy barrier, which rationalizes the high reaction rate. On the basis of this result, the scope of the reaction was extended to the synthesis of aryl- and alkyl-substituted alkynes containing a broad range of functional groups. New sulfur nucleophiles such as thioglycosides, thioacids, and sodium hydrogen sulfide were also alkynylated successfully to lead to the most general and practical method yet reported for the synthesis of thioalkynes.},

@article{Valeev2006,
abstract = {Theoretical investigations of charge transport in organic materials are generally based on the "energy splitting in dimer" method and routinely assume that the transport parameters (site energies and transfer integrals) determined from monomer and dimer calculations can be reliably used to describe extended systems. Here, we demonstrate that this transferability can fail even in molecular crystals with weak van der Waals intermolecular interactions, due to the substantial (but often ignored) impact of polarization effects, particularly on the site energies. We show that the neglect of electronic polarization leads to qualitatively incorrect values and trends for the transfer integrals computed with the energy splitting method, even in simple prototypes such as ethylene or pentacene dimers. The polarization effect in these systems is largely electrostatic in nature and can change dramatically upon transition from a dimer to an extended system. For example, the difference in site energy for a prototypical "face-to-edge" one-dimensional stack of pentacene molecules is calculated to be 30{\%} greater than that in the "face-to-edge" dimer, whereas the site energy difference in the pentacene crystal is vanishingly small. Importantly, when computed directly in the framework of localized monomer orbitals, the transfer integral values for dimer and extended systems are very similar.},

All 241 experimental crystal structures are reproduced very well: the average r.m.s.

abstract = {Limited searching in the conformational space is one of the major obstacles for investigating protein dynamics by numerical approaches. For this reason, classical all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of proteins tend to be confined to local energy minima, particularly when the bulk solvent is treated explicitly. To overcome this problem, we have developed a novel replica exchange protocol that uses modified force-field parameters to treat interparticle nonbonded potentials within the protein and between protein and solvent atoms, leaving unperturbed those relative to solventsolvent interactions. We have tested the new protocol on the 18-residue-long tip of the P domain of calreticulin in an explicit solvent. With only eight replicas, we have been able to considerably enhance the conformational space sampled during a 100 ns simulation, compared to as many parallel classical molecular dynamics simulations of the same length or to a single one lasting 450 ns. A direct comparison between the various simulations has been possible thanks to the implementation of the weighted histogram analysis method, by which conformations simulated with modified force-field parameters can be assigned different weights. Interatom, inter-residue distances in the structural ensembles obtained with our novel replica exchange approach and by classical MD simulations compare equally well with those derived from NMR data. Rare events, such as unfolding and refolding, occur with reasonable statistical frequency. Visiting of conformations characterized by very small Boltzmann weights is also possible. Despite their low probability, such regions of the conformational space may play an important role in the search for local potential-energy minima and in dynamically controlled functions.},

abstract = {Organic nanowires and microfibers are excellent model systems for charge transport in organic semiconductors under nanoscopic confinement and may be relevant for future nanoelectronic devices. For this purpose, however, the preparation of well-ordered organic nanowires with uniform lateral dimensions remains a challenge to achieve. Here, we used the self-assembly of oligopeptide-substituted perylene bisimides and quaterthiophenes to obtain well-ordered nanofibrils. The individual nanofibrils were investigated by spectroscopic and imaging methods, and the preparation of hierarchically structured microfibers of aligned nanofibrils allowed for a comprehensive structural characterization on all length scales with molecular level precision. Thus, we showed that the molecular chirality resulted in supramolecular helicity, which supposedly serves to suppress lateral aggregation. We also proved that, as a result, the individual nanofibrils comprised a single stack of the $\pi$-conjugated molecules at their core. Moreover, the conformational flexibility between the hydrogen-bonded oligopeptides and the $\pi$-$\pi$ stacked chromophores gave rise to synergistically enhanced strong $\pi$-$\pi$ interactions and hydrogen-bonding. The result is a remarkably tight $\pi$-$\pi$ stacking inside the nanofibrils, irrespective of the electronic nature of the employed chromophores, which may render them suitable nanowire models to investigate one-dimensional charge transport along defined $\pi$-$\pi$ stacks of p-type or n-type semiconductors.},

Specifying initially to second-order terms, we show that our ab initio correlation potential provides the correct shape compared to those from reference quantum Monte Carlo calculations, and we demonstrate the superiority of using Fock matrix elements or more general infinite-order semicanonical transformations. This enables us to introduce a method that is guaranteed to converge to the right answer in the correlation and basis set limit, just as does ab initio wave function theory. We also demonstrate that the energies obtained from this generalized second-order method [OEP-MBPT2-f] and [OEP-MBPT2-sc] are often of coupled-cluster accuracy and substantially better than ordinary Hartree-Fock based second-order MBPT=MP2.},

Harmonic force fields are obtained using density functional theory (DFT), MP2 and SCF methodologies, and a [5s4p2d/3s2p] (TZ2P) basis set. DFT calculations use the LSDA, BLYP, and Becke3LYP (B3LYP) density functionals. Mid-IR spectra predicted using LSDA, BLYP, and B3LYP force fields are of significantly different quality, the B3LYP force field yielding spectra in clearly superior, and overall excellent, agreement with experiment. The MP2 force field yields spectra in slightly worse agreement with experiment than the B3LYP force field. The SCF force field yields spectra in poor agreement with experiment. The basis set dependence of B3LYP force fields is also explored: the 6-31G* and TZ2P basis sets give very similar results while the 3-21G basis set yields spectra in substantially worse agreement with experiment.},

We then assessed the newly developed BB1K method against a saddle point geometries database, a database of 42 barrier heights, the AE6 representative atomization energy database, a mol. geometries data set, and a set of 13 zero point energies. The results show that BB1K can give excellent saddle point geometries and barrier heights, and its performance for calcg. atomization energies is 40{\%} better than MPW1K. Using a mean mean unsigned error criterion that equally wts. the errors in barrier heights and in bond energies, the new BB1K method outperforms all other DFT and hybrid DFT methods by a large margin, and we therefore conclude that it is the best d. functional-type method for thermochem. kinetics.

@article{Tao2005,
abstract = {It is known that the nonempirical generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) provides a much more realistic description of the short-range part of the van der Waals (vdW) interaction than does the local spin density (LSD) approximation. In the present work, the ability of the higher-level nonempirical meta-GGA of Tao, Perdew, Staroverov, and Scuseria (TPSS) to describe vdW interaction is tested self-consistently in ten rare-gas dimers with Z< or =36. The one-parameter hybrid version (TPSSh) of the TPSS exchange-correlation functional is also included in this test. Calculations show that both TPSS and TPSSh functionals correctly yield vdW bonds in these dimers and significantly improve the prediction of bond lengths, binding energies, and harmonic vibrational frequencies over LSD. The rather close agreement of TPSS with PBE for these dimers confirms a principle of the TPSS construction: preservation of the PBE large-gradient behavior. More importantly, it suggests that TPSS can serve as a platform on which to construct a still-higher level of nonempirical functionals. Compared with the PBE GGA, TPSS, and TPSSh yield a slightly weaker binding. As for normally bonded molecules, TPSSh yields the most accurate vibrational frequencies. The typically too-long bond lengths and too-small binding energies of TPSS meta-GGA suggest the need for some long-range vdW interaction correction even in this class of systems. The effect of basis-set superposition error on the calculated properties of these vdW systems is investigated. We also show that the relatively strong anharmonic effects in the rare-gas dimers are described remarkably well by the Morse potential.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

By only considering two-center integrals the Hamiltonian and overlap matrix elements are calculated out of suitable input densities and potentials rather than fitted to experimental data. We can derive analytical functions for the C-C, C-H, and H-H Hamiltonian and overlap matrix elements. The usual short-range repulsive potential appearing in most TB models is fitted to self-consistent calculations performed within the LDA. The calculation of forces is easy and allows an application of the method to molecular-dynamics simulations. Despite its extreme simplicity, the method is transferable to complex carbon and hydrocarbon systems. The determination of equilibrium geometries, total energies, and vibrational modes of carbon clusters, hydrocarbon molecules, and solid-state modifications of carbon yield results showing an overall good agreement with more sophisticated methods.},

abstract = {Starting from our earlier model [J. Chem. Phys. 66, 1496 (1977)] a simple expression is derived for the radial dependent damping functions for the individual dispersion coefficients C2n for arbitrary even orders 2n. The damping functions are only a function of the Born–Mayer range parameter b and thus can be applied to all systems for which this is known or can be estimated. For H(1S)–H(1S) the results are in almost perfect agreement with the very accurate recent ab initio damping functions of Koide, Meath, and Allnatt. Comparisons with less accurate previous calculations for other systems also show a satisfactory agreement. By adding a Born–Mayer repulsive term [A exp(−bR)] to the damped dispersion potential, a simple universal expression is obtained for the well region of the atom–atom van der Waals potential with only five essential parameters A, b, C6, C8, and C10. The model has been tested for the following representative systems: H23$\Sigma$, He2, and Ar2 as well as NaK 3$\Sigma$ and LiHg, which include four chemically different types of van der Waals interactions for which either very precise theoretical or experimental data is available. For each system the ab initio dispersion coefficients together with the well‐known parameters ϵ and Rm were used to determine A and b from the model potential. With these values the reduced potentials were calculated and found to agree with the experimental potentials to better than 1{\%} and always less than the experimental uncertainties. Some of the implications of the new model are discussed.},

abstract = {Conspectus Kohn-Sham density functional theory offers a powerful and robust formalism for investigating the electronic structure of many-body systems while providing a practical balance of accuracy and computational cost unmatched by other methods. Despite this success, the commonly used semilocal approximations have difficulties in properly describing attractive dispersion interactions that decay with R(-6) at large intermolecular distances. Even in the short to medium range, most semilocal density functionals fail to give an accurate description of weak interactions. The omnipresence of dispersion interactions, which are neglected in the most popular electronic structure framework, has stimulated intense developments during the past decade. In this Account, we summarize our effort to develop and implement dispersion corrections that dramatically reduce the failures of both inter- and intramolecular interaction energies. The proposed schemes range from improved variants of empirical atom pairwise dispersion correction (e.g., dD10) to robust formulations dependent upon the electron density. Emphasis has been placed on introducing more physics into a modified Tang and Toennies damping function and deriving accurate dispersion coefficients. Our most sophisticated and established density-dependent correction, dDsC, is based on a simple generalized gradient approximation (GGA)-like reformulation of the exchange hole dipole moment introduced by Becke and Johnson. Akin to its empirical precursor, dDsC dramatically improves the interaction energy of a variety of standard density functionals simultaneously for typical intermolecular complexes and shorter-range interactions occurring within molecules. The broad applicability and robustness of the dDsC scheme is demonstrated on various representative reaction energies, geometries, and molecular dynamic simulations. The suitability of the a posteriori correction is also established through comparisons with the more computationally demanding self-consistent implementation. The proposed correction is then exploited to identify the key factors at the origin of the errors in thermochemistry beyond van der Waals complexes. Particular focus is placed on charge-transfer and mixed-valence complexes, which are relevant to the field of organic electronics. These types of complexes represent insightful examples for which the delocalization error may partially counterbalance the missing dispersion. Our devised methodology reveals the true performance of standard density functional approximations and the subtle interplay between the two types of errors. The analysis presented provides guidance for future functional development that could further improve the modeling of the structures and properties of molecular materials. Overall, the proposed state-of-the-art approaches have contributed to stress the crucial role of dispersion and improve their description in both straightforward van der Waals complexes and more challenging chemical situations. For the treatment of the latter, we have also provided relevant insights into which type of density functionals to favor.},

abstract = {The ground-state energy and density of a many-electron system are often calculated by Kohn-Sham density functional theory. We describe a ladder of approximations for the exchange-correlation energy as a functional of the electron density. At the lowest rung of this ladder, the contribution to the energy from a volume element of 3-dimensional space is determined by the local density there. Higher rungs or levels incorporate increasingly complex ingredients constructed from the density or the Kohn-Sham orbitals in or around this volume element. We identify which additional exact conditions can be satisfied at each level, and discuss the extent to which the functionals at each level may be constructed without empirical input. We also discuss the research that remains to be done at the exact-exchange level, and present our “dreams of a final theory.” “Jacob left Beer-sheba and went toward Haran. He came to a certain place and stayed there for the night, because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones of the place, he put it under his head and lay down in that place. And he dreamed that there was a ladder set up on the earth, the top of it reaching to heaven; and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.”},

@article{Goerigk2011,
abstract = {Dispersion-corrected density functional theory is assessed on the new S66 and S66x8 benchmark sets for non-covalent interactions. In total, 17 different density functionals are evaluated. Two flavors of our latest additive London-dispersion correction DFT-D3 and DFT-D3(BJ), which differ in their short-range damping functions, are tested. In general, dispersion corrections are again shown to be crucial to obtain reliable non-covalent interaction energies and equilibrium distances. The corrections strongly diminish the performance differences between the functionals, and in summary most dispersion-corrected methods can be recommended. DFT-D3 and DFT-D3(BJ) also yield similar results but for most functionals and intermolecular distances, the rational Becke–Johnson scheme performs slightly better. Particularly, the statistical analysis for S66x8, which covers also non-equilibrium complex geometries, shows that the Minnesota class of functionals is also improved by the D3 scheme. The best methods on the (meta-)GGA or hybrid- (meta-)GGA level are B97-D3, BLYP-D3(BJ), PW6B95-D3, MPW1B95-D3 and LC-$\omega$PBE-D3. Double-hybrid functionals are the most accurate and robust methods, and in particular PWPB95-D3 and B2-PLYP-D3(BJ) can be recommended. The best DFT-D3 and DFT-D3(BJ) approaches are competitive to specially adapted perturbation methods and clearly outperform standard MP2. Comparisons between S66, S22 and parts of the GMTKN30 database show that the S66 set provides statistically well-behaved data and can serve as a valuable tool for, for example, fitting purposes or cross-validation of other benchmark databases.},

abstract = {The use of individual molecules as functional electronic devices was proposed in 1974 (ref. 1). Since then, advances in the field of nanotechnology have led to the fabrication of various molecule devices and devices based on monolayer arrays of molecules. Single molecule devices are expected to have interesting electronic properties, but devices based on an array of molecules are easier to fabricate and could potentially be more reliable. However, most of the previous work on array-based devices focused on two-terminal structures: demonstrating, for example, negative differential resistance, rectifiers, and re-configurable switching. It has also been proposed that diode switches containing only a few two-terminal molecules could be used to implement simple molecular electronic computer logic circuits. However, three-terminal devices, that is, transistors, could offer several advantages for logic operations compared to two-terminal switches, the most important of which is 'gain'-the ability to modulate the conductance. Here, we demonstrate gain for electronic transport perpendicular to a single molecular layer ( approximately 10-20 A) by using a third gate electrode. Our experiments with field-effect transistors based on self-assembled monolayers demonstrate conductance modulation of more than five orders of magnitude. In addition, inverter circuits have been prepared that show a gain as high as six. The fabrication of monolayer transistors and inverters might represent an important step towards molecular-scale electronics.},

abstract = {Modern optoelectronic devices, such as light-emitting diodes, field-effect transistors and organic solar cells require well controlled motion of charges for their efficient operation. The understanding of the processes that determine charge transport is therefore of paramount importance for designing materials with improved structure-property relationships. Before discussing different regimes of charge transport in organic semiconductors, we present a brief introduction into the conceptual framework in which we interpret the relevant photophysical processes. That is, we compare a molecular picture of electronic excitations against the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger semiconductor band model. After a brief description of experimental techniques needed to measure charge mobilities, we then elaborate on the parameters controlling charge transport in technologically relevant materials. Thus, we consider the influences of electronic coupling between molecular units, disorder, polaronic effects and space charge. A particular focus is given to the recent progress made in understanding charge transport on short time scales and short length scales. The mechanism for charge injection is briefly addressed towards the end of this chapter.},

abstract = {In this paper an overview of the development of organic photovoltaics is given, with emphasis on polymer-basedsolar cells. The observation of photoconductivity in solid anthracene in the beginning of the 19th century markedthe start of this field. The first real investigations of photovoltaic (PV) devices came in the 1950s, where a number of organic dyes, particularly chlorophyll and related compounds, were studied. In the 1980s the first polymers (including poly(sulphur nitride) and polyacetylene) were investigated in PV cells. However, simple PV devices based on dyes or polymers yield limited power conversion efficiencies (PCE), typically well below 0.1{\%}. A major breakthrough came in 1986 when Tang discovered that bringing a donor and an acceptor together in one cell could dramatically increase the PCE to 1{\%}. This concept of heterojunction has since been widely exploited in a number of donor– acceptor cells, including dye/dye, polymer/dye, polymer/polymer and polymer/fullerene blends. Due to the high electron affinity of fullerene, polymer/fullerene blends have been subject to particular investigation during the past decade. Earlier problems in obtaining efficient charge carrier separation have been overcome andPCE of more than 3{\%} have been reported. Different strategies have been used to gain better control over the morphology and further improve efficiency. Among these, covalent attachment of fullerenes to the polymer backbone, creating so-calleddouble-cable polymers, is the latest. The improvedPCE of plastic solar cells combinedwith increased(shelf andoperating) lifetime, superior material properties andavailable manufacturing techniques may push plastic PVs to the market place within a few years.},

It has had profound impact on the way we live and the way we work. The first part of this paper covers the events that led to the discovery of the transistor effect and the invention of the point contact transistor in December of 1947. It continues with the development of the theory of the junction transistor in early 1948 and the fabrication of the first grown junction transistor in 1950. It is fair to say that this event completed the invention of the transistor and developed a fundamental understanding of how it worked. The second part of the paper describes the major hurdles that had to be overcome and the major breakthroughs that had to be made to turn an exciting invention into a far reaching technical innovation. This phase took approximately another 10 years. By that time, high performance, high reliability transistors could be manufactured in large quantity and at low cost. Importantly the foundation had been laid for the invention of the integrated circuit and the dramatic development of the microelectronics industry. The final part of the paper suggests some of the reasons why such an important technological innovation could occur in a relatively short period of time and be such an unqualified success. Finally, there are some comments on how much further this technology can go and when its rapid progress may come to an end},
